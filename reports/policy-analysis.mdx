# Single Policy Analysis

> The **Single Policy Analysis Report** helps producers and brokers quickly analyze a client or prospect's existing insurance policy. In just minutes, Qumis reads the policy, identifies key strengths and weaknesses, and highlights opportunities for you to negotiate better terms or win the account—a process that might otherwise take days.

---

## What this report does

When a prospect sends you a copy of their current policy, Qumis automatically:

- Reads and interprets the entire policy.
- Produces an executive summary that highlights key coverages, exclusions, and gaps.
- Pinpoints areas where you can provide better coverage or pricing.
- Lets you chat with the report for deeper insights.

All findings are organized into a professional, point-by-point report designed for quick review and client discussions.

## Before you start

  **Prerequisites for Single Policy Analysis:**
  - Have the prospect's policy document ready (PDF format works best)
  - Know the prospect's business type or coverage needs (this helps add context)
  - Have 5-10 minutes to set up and generate the report

## 2) Upload your policy document

A three-step workflow guides you through creating your report:

- **Step 1: Policy Documents**
- **Step 2: Additional Information**
- **Step 3: Generate Report**

On **Step 1: Policy Documents**, add the prospect's policy:

1. Drag and drop your file into the **Drop files here** area, or click to select a file from your computer.
2. Alternatively, click **Search and Add Documents From Vault** to pull a previously uploaded policy from your Vault.
3. Supported formats include PDF, Word, Excel, and images (JPG, PNG, TIFF).
4. Once uploaded, the file appears with a green checkmark and document name.

Make sure you upload one policy document per analysis—this ensures accuracy and focus.

## 3) Add additional context (optional)

On **Step 2: Additional Information**, you can provide optional context to help Qumis tailor the analysis.

1. Click **Additional Information** on the left sidebar or click the **Additional Information** button to proceed to Step 2.
2. In the text box labeled "Please describe any additional information relevant for the analysis," add context such as:
    - The prospect's industry or business type (e.g., "construction contractor," "healthcare facility")
    - Specific operations or concerns (e.g., "client recently expanded internationally," "they work with independent contractors")
    - What you'd like to focus on (e.g., "identify gaps in contractor coverage," "analyze exclusions")
    - Any known limitations of their current coverage

Providing context can make your final report more tailored and insightful.

## 4) Generate your report

Once your document is uploaded and any optional context is added:

1. Click **Generate Single Policy Analysis** at the bottom right.
2. Qumis begins reading and interpreting the policy.
3. The process takes approximately 5–10 minutes, depending on document length and complexity.
4. You'll see a progress screen with status updates such as "Compiling Insights" and "Validating Accuracy."
5. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

Qumis uses a multi-agent AI system to ensure accuracy and context-aware insights across all policy sections.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My report is taking too long to generate">
    Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload your document. Complex or lengthy policies may take slightly longer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't see my uploaded document">
    Ensure you've added it in the "Policy Documents" section (Step 1) before clicking "Generate Report." Check that the file shows a green checkmark and document name after upload.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I analyze more than one policy at once?">
    The Single Policy tool is designed for one document at a time to ensure accuracy and focus. For side-by-side comparisons, use the **Comparisons** feature instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where are my past analyses?">
    All completed reports appear on the **Single Policy Analysis dashboard**. Go to **Single Policy** in the left sidebar to access them. Reports show name, associated files, and last modified date.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit the report after it's generated?">
    The report itself is generated by Qumis and cannot be directly edited, but you can add notes and chat questions. Use the chat feature to clarify specific points or ask for deeper analysis on any section.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to compare two policies">
    Create separate Single Policy Analysis reports for each policy, then use the **Comparisons** tool to review them side-by-side with detailed variance analysis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Where Single Policy Analysis fits in the Qumis platform

Single Policy Analysis is purpose-built for the broker/producer workflow of evaluating prospects' existing policies. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc questions, **Comparisons** for side-by-side policy reviews, and **Custom Reports** for tailored client deliverables.

---

### Why use Single Policy Analysis?

Traditional policy analysis can take hours or days—reading, annotating, comparing, and summarizing dense legal documents. With Qumis, you can analyze a full policy in minutes, identify coverage gaps and negotiation opportunities instantly, and position your firm as a trusted advisor to win new business faster. What once took days now takes minutes, letting you focus on relationships, not paperwork.
