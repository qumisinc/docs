## What this report does

The Custom Report is the most flexible tool in Qumis, allowing you to create tailored analyses for any insurance-related task. It's most helpful for **account managers**, **brokers**, and **producers**, but can benefit any Qumis user who needs specialized analysis beyond the standard report types.

With Custom Reports, you can:

- Define exactly what you want Qumis to analyze and how
- Create specialized reports for unique client situations
- Generate custom policy reviews with specific focus areas
- Produce analysis formatted exactly for your needs
- Combine multiple analytical perspectives in one report
- Tailor the analysis and output to your specific client or document set
- Generate reports suitable for client-facing materials or internal insights

You can also chat directly with the report to explore findings in more depth. Each chat is saved, and multiple threads can be maintained per report for different topics or follow-up analyses.

> üí° You will need **at least one document** and **a prompt** to create a Custom Report.

_"You will be provided with 1 document: General liability insurance policy for a construction company operating in the Southeastern United States._

_Task: Analyze the provided general liability insurance policy for a construction company offering general construction, design/build, construction management, and upfit/renovation services in the Southeastern United States.

- _Named Insureds: List all named insureds and verify their accuracy._

## Best practices

- **Be specific in your prompts.** The more detailed your instructions, the better Qumis can tailor the output to your needs.
- **Define your audience.** Specify whether the report is for executives, underwriters, clients, or internal use‚Äîthis affects tone and detail level.
- **Keep prompts focused on a single objective** (e.g., exclusions analysis, policy comparison) for clearer results.
- **Request specific formats.** If you want tables, bullet points, or particular section structures, state this clearly in your prompt.
- **Upload relevant, complete documents** for more accurate results.
- **Save successful prompts.** When you create a prompt that works well, save it to the Prompt Library for future use.
- **Iterate and refine.** If the first report isn't quite right, use the chat feature to refine the analysis, then update your prompt for next time.
- **Use for unique situations.** Custom Reports excel when standard report types don't quite fit your needs.
- **Leverage the magic wand.** Use the magic wand icon to refine your prompt if you're unsure how to structure it.
- **Test with different formats.** Experiment with different prompt structures to find what works best for your use cases.

## Troubleshooting

**My report didn't produce the output I expected.**

- Review your prompt for clarity. Did you specify exactly what you wanted and how you wanted it formatted?
- Use the chat feature to ask Qumis to reformat or refocus specific sections.

**The report is too general or not detailed enough.**

- Your prompt may need more specificity. Add detailed instructions about what to analyze and how deep to go.
- Specify that you want "detailed" or "comprehensive" analysis with examples.

**My custom report is taking too long to generate.**

- Average generation time is 5‚Äì10 minutes. Very complex prompts may take longer.
- If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or simplify your prompt.

**I want to reuse a successful prompt.**

- Save effective prompts to the Prompt Library so you can select them from the dropdown for future reports.

**Where are my past custom reports?**

- All completed reports appear on the **Custom Report dashboard**. Go to **Custom Report** in the left sidebar to access them.

**Can I update a report after it's generated?**

- The report itself is fixed, but you can use the chat feature to get additional analysis or clarifications, which are saved with the report.
