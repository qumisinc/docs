## What this report does

The Custom Report is the most flexible tool in Qumis, allowing you to create tailored analyses for any insurance-related task. It's most helpful for **account managers**, **brokers**, and **producers**, but can benefit any Qumis user who needs specialized analysis beyond the standard report types.

With Custom Reports, you can:

- Define exactly what you want Qumis to analyze and how
- Create specialized reports for unique client situations
- Generate custom policy reviews with specific focus areas
- Produce analysis formatted exactly for your needs
- Combine multiple analytical perspectives in one report
- Tailor the analysis and output to your specific client or document set
- Generate reports suitable for client-facing materials or internal insights

You can also chat directly with the report to explore findings in more depth. Each chat is saved, and multiple threads can be maintained per report for different topics or follow-up analyses.

<Note>
You will need **at least one document** and **a prompt** to create a Custom Report.
</Note>

---

## Before you start

- Have at least one document ready to analyze (policy, quote, contract, claim document, etc.).
- Know what analysis or output you want Qumis to produce.
- Consider whether you have a saved prompt in the Prompt Library or need to write a custom prompt.
- Think about your audience—is this for internal review or client presentation?

## 4) Create your report description (prompt)

### Choose your approach

You have two options:

**Option A: Use a saved prompt from Prompt Library**

1. Click the **Select A Report Template** dropdown.
2. Choose from your saved prompts in the Prompt Library.
3. The prompt will populate automatically, and you can edit it if needed.

**Option B: Write a custom prompt**

1. Type directly in the large text box.
2. Follow the guidance provided to create an effective prompt.

<Frame caption="Step 3: Description with prompt template selector and custom prompt input">
<img
  style={{ width:"1200%" }}
/>
</Frame>

<Info>
- You can write your own prompt or select one from your **Prompt Library** using the dropdown.
- Prompts from the library are great for consistency across teams.
- If your organization would like standard report prompts automatically added to every user's Prompt Library, please contact your **Customer Success Manager**.
</Info>

### How to write an effective prompt

Your prompt should include:

**1. Context** — Describe the documents you uploaded

- Example: "You will be provided with 1 document: [Policy Name] - [Description]"

**2. Task** — What would you like Qumis to analyze and answer

- Be specific about what you want analyzed
- Define the scope and focus areas
- Specify any particular angles or perspectives

**3. Output Style** — How you want the results presented

- Specify format preferences (e.g., narrative summary, table, bullet points)
- Define the level of detail needed
- Indicate the intended audience and appropriate tone

### Example: Writing an effective prompt

Here's an example of how a detailed, context-rich prompt might look:

_"You will be provided with 1 document: General liability insurance policy for a construction company operating in the Southeastern United States._

_Task: Analyze the provided general liability insurance policy for a construction company offering general construction, design/build, construction management, and upfit/renovation services in the Southeastern United States. The analysis should be comprehensive and objective, identifying potential biases or limitations in the policy's coverage. The report should be suitable for a construction company executive seeking to understand the policy's strengths and weaknesses. The analysis should focus on the following aspects:_

- _Named Insureds: List all named insureds and verify their accuracy._
- _Coverage Territory: Clearly define the geographical coverage of the policy._
- _Class Codes and Exposures: Create a table listing all class codes, their corresponding exposure bases, and the locations they apply to._
- _Policy Form: Determine if the policy is occurrence-based, claims-made, or claims-made and reported. Justify your conclusion._
- _Limits, Deductibles, and Retentions: List all policy limits, deductibles, and retentions, clarifying their application..."_

## Best practices

- **Be specific in your prompts.** The more detailed your instructions, the better Qumis can tailor the output to your needs.
- **Define your audience.** Specify whether the report is for executives, underwriters, clients, or internal use—this affects tone and detail level.
- **Keep prompts focused on a single objective** (e.g., exclusions analysis, policy comparison) for clearer results.
- **Request specific formats.** If you want tables, bullet points, or particular section structures, state this clearly in your prompt.
- **Upload relevant, complete documents** for more accurate results.
- **Save successful prompts.** When you create a prompt that works well, save it to the Prompt Library for future use.
- **Iterate and refine.** If the first report isn't quite right, use the chat feature to refine the analysis, then update your prompt for next time.
- **Use for unique situations.** Custom Reports excel when standard report types don't quite fit your needs.
- **Leverage the magic wand.** Use the magic wand icon to refine your prompt if you're unsure how to structure it.
- **Test with different formats.** Experiment with different prompt structures to find what works best for your use cases.
