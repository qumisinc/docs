> The **Contract Review Report** helps account managers and service teams quickly determine whether an insured's policies, certificates, or quotes meet the insurance requirements outlined in a contract, lease, or agreement. Qumis automates the compliance review process—reading both documents, comparing requirements against coverages, and clearly identifying which requirements are compliant, non-compliant, or ambiguous—all in minutes instead of hours.

## What this report does

Qumis supports multiple types of contract analysis. Select the type that best matches your review scenario:

- **Contract Review** — General review of insurance requirements vs. policy documents.
- **Contract Compliance Review** — Detailed compliance validation of policy terms against requirements.
- **COI vs. Requirements** — Compare a Certificate of Insurance (COI) to contract requirements.
- **Lease & Agreement Analysis** — Analyze lease language for insurance compliance and liability clauses.
- **Construction Contracts** — Review construction agreements for indemnification and liability provisions.

The workflow is the same for all report types. Qumis automates compliance verification by reading both the contract and insurance materials, matching requirements clause by clause, and identifying coverage gaps.

---

## Before you start

- Have the contract or agreement document ready (the document containing insurance requirements).
- Have the client's insurance documentation ready (policy, COI, quote, or evidence of coverage).
- Know what type of analysis you're performing (this helps you select the right report type).
- Have 5-10 minutes to set up and generate the report.

## 1) Access the Contract Review tool

1. From the sidebar, click **Contracts**.
2. You'll see a dashboard listing existing contract reports and the different review type options.
3. Select the report type that best fits your situation (e.g., Contract Compliance Review or COI vs. Requirements).

You can revisit any completed report at any time—all are automatically saved.

## 2) Upload the contract document

A four-step workflow guides you through creating your analysis:

- **Step 1: Contract Documents**
- **Step 2: Insurance Related Documents**
- **Step 3: Additional Information**
- **Step 4: Generate Report**

On **Step 1: Contract Documents**, upload the contract or agreement containing the insurance requirements:

1. You can add documents in two ways:
   - Click **Search and Add Documents From Vault** to pull a previously uploaded contract from your Vault, or
   - Drag and drop files into the **Drop files here** area, or click to select files from your computer.
2. Supported file types include PDF, Word, Excel, and image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF).
3. Confirm the document appears with a green checkmark before proceeding.

This document is the foundation for Qumis to extract and summarize the insurance requirements.

## 3) Upload related insurance documents

On **Step 2: Insurance Related Documents**, upload the documents you want to check for compliance:

Examples of insurance documents to upload:

- Insurance policies
- Quotes or proposals
- Certificates of Insurance (COI)
- Evidence of Property Insurance (EPI)

1. Add documents using the same methods as Step 1: search Vault or drag/drop from your computer.
2. You can upload one or multiple insurance-related files.
3. Qumis will automatically identify relevant coverages and match them to the contract's requirements.

## 4) Add additional context (optional)

On **Step 3: Additional Information**, you can provide optional context to help Qumis interpret the documents correctly.

1. Click **Additional Information** on the left or click the **Additional Information** button to proceed to Step 3.
2. In the text box, provide context such as:
   - What type of review you're performing
   - Specific coverage areas to focus on
   - Client business type or special circumstances
   - Recent policy changes or updates to verify
   - Clarifications on ambiguous contract language

Adding clear notes helps tailor the AI's analysis to your exact needs.

## 5) Generate your report

Once all documents and information are uploaded:

1. Click **Generate Contract Analysis** at the bottom right.
2. Qumis begins reading both the contract and insurance materials, matching requirements clause by clause.
3. The process takes approximately 5–10 minutes. Qumis uses a multi-agent AI workflow to ensure accuracy, cross-reference coverage details, and summarize results clearly.
4. You'll see a progress screen with status updates.
5. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

## 6) Review your completed report

When complete, you'll see the **Compliance Comparison Report** with the following structure:

### Report tabs

- **Report** — The full compliance analysis (default view)
- **Documents** — The source contract and insurance documents used for the analysis

### Compliance Comparison Table

The report includes a structured table that summarizes:

**Contractual Requirement** — Extracted requirement from the contract (e.g., "General Liability: \$1M per occurrence").

**Policy Details** — The corresponding coverage or limit found in the insurance documents.

**Compliance Level** — Status indicator showing:

- Compliant — Coverage meets or exceeds the requirement
- Non-Compliant — Coverage does not meet the requirement or is missing
- Ambiguous — Requirement or coverage is unclear and may need clarification
- Not Available — Information is not available to make a determination

**Notes** — Provides context, explanation, or verification details.

This view makes it easy to identify coverage gaps, confirm compliance, and prepare recommendations for your client.

## 7) Chat with your contract report

Each report includes a **Qumis Clerk** chat assistant that allows you to explore findings in more depth.

You can ask questions such as:

- "Which requirements are non-compliant?"
- "Does the COI show sufficient General Liability coverage?"
- "What are the major gaps in this agreement?"
- "Summarize the special form insurance requirement."
- "What do I need to ask the client to bring into compliance?"

Chats are saved automatically, and you can maintain multiple threads per report—great for ongoing client discussions and follow-ups.

---

## 8) Use the report for client follow-up

Once you have your Compliance Report, use it to guide next steps:

**Identify compliance gaps**

- Highlight which requirements are non-compliant with red status indicators.
- Use the Notes column to explain specifically what's missing or inadequate.

**Communicate required changes**

- Share non-compliant items with clients clearly and professionally.
- Use the detailed notes to explain what changes are needed.
- Provide specific guidance on what coverage or limits need to be added or increased.

**Prioritize follow-up**

- Focus on high-risk non-compliance items (e.g., missing additional insured endorsements, inadequate limits).
- Address ambiguous items by asking the carrier or client for clarification.

**Document your work**

- Keep the report on file as documentation that you reviewed compliance.
- Reference it in communications with clients and carriers.
- Use it to track which items have been resolved over time.

---

## 9) Access previous reports

Your previously generated Contract Review Reports are saved and listed on the Contracts dashboard.

1. Go to **Contracts** in the left sidebar.
2. You'll see a table of all your reports showing:
   - NAME — Report name
   - FILES — The contract and insurance documents analyzed
   - LAST MODIFIED — When the report was created or last accessed
3. Click any report to open it, review the compliance table, or add new chat questions.

## Best practices

- **Use the right report type.** Select the Contract Review type that best matches your situation for more targeted analysis.
- **Include all relevant documents.** Upload both the contract requirements and all insurance documentation so Qumis can make a complete assessment.
- **Add context about special situations.** If there are unique circumstances, explain them in Additional Information so Qumis can provide better analysis.
- **Review compliance items systematically.** Go through the report in order, starting with high-priority items like limits and additional insured requirements.
- **Use chat for clarification.** If a compliance determination is unclear, ask Qumis to explain the specific contract language or coverage provision.
- **Follow up on ambiguous items.** When a requirement is marked as ambiguous, use the Notes to understand what clarification is needed, then follow up with the carrier or client.
- **Save chat conversations.** Keep important Q&A threads in the report as documentation of your compliance review.
- **Track changes over time.** When a client brings something into compliance, generate a new report to document the resolution.

## Time savings example

**Traditional compliance review (typical):**

- Read and understand contract requirements: 30-60 minutes
- Review insurance documents: 30-60 minutes
- Compare coverage to requirements: 1-2 hours
- Document findings and create report: 30-60 minutes
- Total: 2.5-4.5 hours per contract review

**With Qumis Contract Review Report:**

- Upload documents: 3 minutes
- Add context: 2 minutes
- Generate report: 5-10 minutes
- Review compliance table and follow up: 5-10 minutes
- Total: 15-25 minutes per contract review

You can now complete multiple contract compliance reviews in the time it would have taken to complete one manually.

---

## Troubleshooting

**I only uploaded a contract, and the system won't generate a report.**

- You must upload at least one insurance-related document to perform a compliance review.

**My report is taking too long to generate.**

- Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or check that all documents uploaded successfully.

**The report shows "Ambiguous" results.**

- This indicates unclear or missing information. Use the chat feature to ask Qumis for clarification, or verify and upload an updated COI or policy version.

**Can I analyze multiple contracts at once?**

- Each report supports one contract set at a time for maximum accuracy. Create separate reports for different contracts.

**Where are my saved reports?**

- All generated reports appear on the **Contracts dashboard** under their respective category. Go to **Contracts** in the left sidebar to access them.

## Where Contract Review Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Contract Review Report** is essential for account management and client service teams. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc questions about specific requirements or coverage, and **Single Policy Analysis** for deeper analysis of specific policies when needed.
