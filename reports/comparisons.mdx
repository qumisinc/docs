# Comparisons

> The **Comparison Report** enables producers and brokers to compare multiple insurance policies, quotes, or binders side by side. Qumis reads and analyzes all uploaded documents, then generates a comprehensive coverage table—detailing key differences in coverages, exclusions, conditions, and policy language—all in minutes instead of days.

---

## What this report does

This tool is ideal when you need to compare:

- A quote vs. the incumbent's policy
- A renewal vs. alternative market quotes
- Multiple binders or applications
- Any other combination of documents where you want to identify meaningful differences

Qumis automatically:

- Compares and analyzes each document in detail
- Highlights coverage differences, exclusions, and conditions
- Evaluates policy language to explain implications for the insured
- Generates a Coverage Table showing side-by-side results, filterable by confidence and impact
- Lets you chat with the report for deeper insights into specific findings

---

## Before you start

- Have at least two documents ready to compare (policies, quotes, binders, applications).
- Know what you're comparing (e.g., "Quote vs. incumbent," "Renewal vs. market options").
- Documents can be up to 1000 pages combined.
- Have 5-10 minutes to set up and generate the report.

## 2) Upload your documents

To generate a Comparison Report, upload **at least two documents** (PDF, Word, Excel, or image formats).

A three-step workflow guides you through creating your comparison:

- **Step 1: Documents**
- **Step 2: Additional Information**
- **Step 3: Generate Report**

On **Step 1: Documents**:

1. Drag and drop your files into the upload area, or click inside the box to select from your computer or Vault.
2. You can upload multiple documents for multi-way comparisons.
3. Each document will appear with a green checkmark once successfully uploaded.
4. You can upload up to 1000 pages total. Qumis will automatically read, align, and compare them.

## 3) Add optional additional context

On **Step 2: Additional Information**, you can provide notes or context to guide the analysis.

1. Click **Additional Information** on the left sidebar or click the **Additional Information** button to proceed to Step 2.
2. In the text box labeled "Please describe any additional information relevant for the analysis," you can add guidance such as:
    - What you're comparing and why (e.g., "Compare renewal policy to last year's version")
    - Areas to focus on (e.g., "Focus on differences in limits and exclusions")
    - Coverage priorities (e.g., "Identify areas of narrower coverage in the renewal")
    - Specific exposures or concerns for the insured

This context helps Qumis prioritize the parts of the documents that matter most to your analysis and client needs.

## 4) Generate your comparison report

Once at least two documents are uploaded and any optional context is added:

1. Click **Generate Comparison** at the bottom right.
2. Qumis begins reading, extracting, and comparing all relevant clauses and conditions.
3. The process takes approximately 5–10 minutes depending on file size and complexity.
4. You'll see a progress screen showing status updates and estimated time.
5. Qumis uses a multi-agent AI workflow for policy parsing, validation, and clause alignment to ensure maximum accuracy.
6. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

## 5) Review your comparison results

When complete, the **Comparison Dashboard** will display an interactive overview of your results with multiple tabs to explore:

- **Report** — Written analysis and findings
- **Visuals** — QumisScore benchmark and coverage alignment chart
- **Documents** — Source documents used for the analysis

### Understand the QumisScore

The **Visuals** tab includes the **QumisScore**—Qumis's AI-generated benchmark comparing how each policy performs across six key dimensions:

- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance** — How well the policy aligns with legal requirements
- **Exclusions and Endorsements** — Breadth and restrictiveness of exclusions versus added coverages
- **Policy Conditions and Definitions** — Clarity and favorability of terms and conditions
- **Claims Handling and Customer Service** — Carrier reputation and claim process quality
- **Cost and Insurer's Financial Stability** — Premium value and carrier financial strength
- **Coverage Alignment with Company Risks and Needs** — How well coverage matches business exposures

Each policy receives a QumisScore from 0-100 relative to the other documents you're comparing. This benchmarking shows which policy is stronger overall and on which specific dimensions, making it easy to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of different options.

The **Coverage Alignment chart** visualizes these six dimensions as a spider/radar chart, giving you a quick visual comparison of how policies stack up against each other.

### Overview metrics

**Match Overview**

- Full Match — identical terms across documents
- Partial Match — similar but different terms
- No Match — terms present in one document but not the other

**Impact Analysis**

- Categorizes differences as Low, Medium, or High impact
- High-impact differences highlighted in red for urgent review

**Action Items**

- Tracks key areas that require your review or client discussion
- Medium impact items (orange) and high impact items (red)

<Image src="/screenshots/25.png" alt="Comparison dashboard showing impact analysis and match overview" width={1200} height={600} />

These insights highlight where material differences exist and where coverage improvements could be negotiated.

## 6) Explore the coverage comparison table

The **Coverage Table** displays each field and clause side by side—showing how each document treats the same concept.

Each row includes:

- Field Name (e.g., "General Aggregate Limit")
- The value or clause language from each document
- A status indicator (Match, Partial, or Mismatch)
- Warning icons highlighting significant differences

### Filters and search

The Coverage Table is fully interactive with multiple filtering options:

- **Status filter** — Show only Matches, Partials, or Mismatches
- **Impact filter** — Focus on Low, Medium, or High impact differences
- **Confidence filter** — Filter by Qumis's confidence level in each match
- **Search bar** — Search for specific fields or coverage types
- **Qumis Insights toggle** — Turn on natural-language explanations of key differences and their implications for the insured

### Asking questions

You can ask questions such as:

- "Where does Policy B have narrower coverage than Policy A?"
- "Which exclusions differ significantly between these two documents?"
- "Explain the impact of the pollution exclusion in both policies."
- "What coverage improvements does the new quote provide?"

Qumis answers based on all documents in the comparison with specific citations.

## 9) Use the QumisScore in your recommendations

The QumisScore is a powerful tool for illustrating policy value to your clients:

**For competitive positioning**

- Show clients which option scores highest overall and on which specific dimensions
- Explain why a higher-scoring policy might be worth the premium difference
- Highlight specific dimension scores where one policy significantly outperforms others

**For identifying improvement opportunities**

- Use dimension scores to identify which areas are weak across all options
- Recommend additional coverage or endorsements to address low-scoring dimensions
- Show where negotiation with carriers could strengthen the policy

**For client education**

- Use the spider chart visual to educate clients on what makes a policy strong
- Explain each of the six dimensions in plain language
- Help clients understand that the highest score doesn't necessarily mean the best fit—context matters

**Important context**

- QumisScore benchmarks policies relative to each other, not against a global standard
- A score of 81 doesn't mean "81% perfect"—it means this policy scores higher on these dimensions compared to the other documents in your comparison
- Always combine QumisScore insights with your professional judgment about the client's specific needs

## 10) Use the comparison for your pitch

Once you have your Comparison Report, use it strategically:

**For quote presentations**

- Show exactly how your quote differs from the incumbent policy
- Highlight areas where you provide better coverage
- Point out where you've negotiated better pricing or terms
- Demonstrate value through professional side-by-side analysis

**For renewal discussions**

- Compare renewal terms to market quotes obtained after going to market
- Show if renewal terms are competitive or if alternatives are available
- Identify what's changed from prior years
- Recommend best option based on coverage and pricing analysis

**For competitive analysis**

- Compare multiple competing quotes objectively
- Show pros and cons of each option
- Recommend the best fit for the prospect's specific needs

**Build credibility**

- The detailed analysis shows you've done thorough due diligence
- Side-by-side comparisons make complex information digestible

## Best practices

- **Compare apples to apples.** Make sure documents are for the same coverage period and business to ensure meaningful comparison.
- **Add strategic context.** Explain what you're comparing and why (e.g., "After going to market, how does renewal compare?") so analysis is targeted.
- **Review high-impact items first.** Focus on medium and high-impact differences that matter most to the prospect and skip low-value differences.
- **Use filters effectively.** Customize the view to show only differences that are relevant to your discussion.
- **Enable Qumis Insights.** Turn on natural-language explanations to better understand implications of differences.
- **Download for client materials.** Export the comparison table to Excel for professional proposal presentation and customization.
- **Ask clarifying questions in chat.** Use the chat feature to understand implications of differences before your pitch.
- **Save your conversations.** Keep chat threads as documentation of your analysis and recommendations.

## Time savings example

**Traditional document comparison (typical):**

- Initial document review: 1-2 hours
- Detailed side-by-side comparison: 2-3 hours
- Creating comparison table/spreadsheet: 1-2 hours
- Identifying implications and recommendations: 1-2 hours
- Total: 5-9 hours per comparison

**With Qumis Comparison Report:**

- Upload documents: 3 minutes
- Add context: 2 minutes
- Generate report: 5-10 minutes
- Review analysis and export to Excel: 5-10 minutes
- Total: 15-25 minutes per comparison

You can now compare multiple competitive options or conduct market analysis in a single afternoon instead of days.

## Troubleshooting

**My comparison is taking too long to generate.**

- Average time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload the documents.

**I uploaded only one file.**

- You must upload at least two documents to generate a comparison.

**I need to upload more than two documents.**

- Qumis supports multiple document comparisons. Add as many documents as you need (up to 1000 pages total). The report will analyze all of them.

**The results seem incomplete.**

- Try toggling filters or enabling Qumis Insights for more contextual explanations. Some fields may be specific to certain policy types and may not appear across all documents.

**Can I compare more than two documents?**

- Yes. You can upload multiple quotes or binders for multi-way comparisons.

**Where are my past comparisons?**

- All completed comparisons appear on the **Comparisons dashboard**. Go to **Comparisons** in the left sidebar to access them.

**Can I add or remove documents from an existing comparison?**

- Create a new comparison to include or exclude different documents. Each comparison is a fixed analysis of the documents included at generation time.

**I want to compare documents with my team.**

- Download the comparison to Excel and share with team members. You can also use the Shared Vault to store documents so your team can access them for their own comparisons.

## Where Comparison Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Comparison Report** complements **Single Policy Analysis** for individual policy review and **Chats** for ad-hoc questions. Use it whenever you need to evaluate multiple documents against each other to make informed recommendations to prospects and clients.

### Why use Comparison Reports?

Policy comparisons are critical during renewal, prospecting, or marketing phases—but traditionally take hours or days to complete. With Qumis, you can compare hundreds of pages in minutes, quickly see where a quote differs from the incumbent, identify coverage gaps and opportunities, and produce professional client-ready materials in less time. By reading every clause and condition, Qumis reveals what's different, why it matters, and how it affects your insured—empowering brokers and producers to make faster, more informed recommendations. What once required extensive manual work now takes just minutes, helping you win renewals, identify upsell opportunities, and strengthen client trust.
