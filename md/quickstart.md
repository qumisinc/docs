## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

### Clone your docs locally

During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.

### Start the preview server

1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

### Install our GitHub app

Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.

### Update your site name and colors

For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!

### Step 3: Go live

### Publish your docs

1. Commit and push your changes.
2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
