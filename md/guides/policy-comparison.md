The Policy Documents screen allows you to upload or search for documents from your Vault

For this comparison, you'll want to upload at least two policy documents - typically the incumbent policy and a competing quote, or multiple quotes you're evaluating.

Your uploaded policy documents will appear with green checkmarks when successfully added

This is where the magic happens. The system will present you with two options:

1. **Copy and paste** coverage items from your existing proposal template or coverage checklist
2. **Select from our comprehensive checklist** of common insurance coverage elements
