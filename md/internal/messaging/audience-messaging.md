This section provides messaging frameworks for organizational decision-makers and budget holders. For day-to-day practitioner messaging that drives adoption and internal advocacy, see [Persona-Specific Messaging](/internal/messaging/persona-messaging).

## Brokerage Executives

**Primary concerns:** Competitive differentiation, talent leverage, E\&O risk reduction, client retention, organic growth from existing accounts

**Lead message:** "Qumis gives your team a coverage advantage your competitors can't match — legal-grade insight and market intelligence that wins accounts, retains clients, and scales your best people's expertise across the organization."

**Key talking points:**

- **Talent multiplier:** Senior coverage expertise scales across junior team members — every account manager and producer operates with the analytical depth of your most experienced people
- **Market intelligence advantage:** Your team doesn't just analyze policies — they benchmark coverage against market standards across thousands of commercial programs, giving clients data-backed confidence that their program is competitive
- **Win rate impact:** Data-driven, citation-linked coverage proposals backed by market context beat incumbent guesswork. Your producers walk into meetings with insights the competition can't access
- **E\&O protection:** Citation-linked analysis creates defensible documentation. Every recommendation traces back to source policy language and market benchmarks
- **Client stickiness and organic growth:** Instant, authoritative coverage answers strengthen relationships. Proactive identification of coverage gaps relative to market norms creates natural upsell and cross-sell conversations that drive organic revenue growth

**Proof point to lead with:** "The brokers at NFP reduced complex policy review time by 80% — and expanded from 50 to 250+ active users within months."

### Messaging rationale

Executives care about competitive positioning, revenue growth, and risk reduction — in that order. The lead message avoids dismissing workflow efficiency (which executives are actively buying) and instead positions Qumis as delivering something competitors can't access: legal-grade analysis combined with proprietary market intelligence. The addition of organic growth and cross-sell language connects directly to the revenue expansion story that justifies platform investment.

## Claims Leadership

**Primary concerns:** Cycle time, indemnity leakage, consistency of coverage determinations, bad-faith exposure, outside counsel spend

**Lead message:** "Qumis gives your claims organization the coverage reasoning capability of experienced coverage counsel — at the speed and consistency your operation demands. Every adjuster makes better coverage determinations, backed by citation-linked analysis and market intelligence that strengthens your positions."

**Key talking points:**

- **Faster, more accurate determinations:** Coverage analysis that took days now takes hours, with citation-linked reasoning that catches exclusions, endorsements, and coverage defenses that manual review misses under deadline pressure
- **Consistency at scale:** Different adjusters interpreting the same policy language differently creates bad-faith exposure and regulatory risk. Qumis standardizes coverage reasoning across your entire claims organization
- **Reduced outside counsel spend:** Coverage questions that currently get sent to outside counsel at $500–$800/hour can be resolved internally with attorney-grade analysis, reserving outside counsel for genuinely complex disputes
- **Market context for coverage positions:** Contextualize coverage determinations against how similar provisions are structured across thousands of commercial programs — strengthening reservation-of-rights letters and coverage positions with market-informed analysis
- **Defensible documentation:** Citation-backed coverage determinations create audit trails that withstand scrutiny from insureds, regulators, and bad-faith plaintiffs

**Proof point to lead with:** "Built by a licensed insurance coverage attorney who understands exactly how coverage determinations get challenged. Trusted by claims teams at top-tier brokerages and carriers handling complex commercial programs."

### Messaging rationale

Claims leadership buys on accuracy, consistency, and defensibility — not speed alone. The outside counsel spend reduction is a concrete, measurable ROI that finance teams understand. Market intelligence lands here as a credibility enhancer for coverage positions, which is how claims leadership actually thinks about data.

## IT & Operations

**Primary concerns:** Security posture, integration complexity, vendor stability, implementation timeline, change management burden

**Lead message:** "Qumis is enterprise-ready from day one — SOC 2 certified, designed for fast deployment, and built to work within your existing technology ecosystem without requiring your team to change how they work."

**Key talking points:**

- **SOC 2 Type I certified:** Enterprise-grade security and compliance, purpose-built for organizations handling sensitive insurance policy and claims data
- **Data isolation and privacy:** Client data is private and never used for AI model training. Meets the data handling standards your most demanding clients require
- **Integration with existing ecosystems:** Designed to work alongside your existing AMS (Applied Epic, Sagitta), document management systems (ImageRight, SharePoint, Box), and email infrastructure (Outlook) — not replace them
- **Minimal IT lift:** Cloud-based deployment with no on-premise infrastructure required. Implementation measured in weeks, not months
- **API-first architecture:** Connects to existing systems and workflows programmatically, enabling custom integrations without disrupting established processes

**Proof point to lead with:** "Trusted by 5 of the top 15 U.S. brokerages, including enterprise-wide deployments at organizations with complex security and compliance requirements."

### Messaging rationale

IT buyers at brokerages have been burned by tools that require ripping out existing infrastructure or creating parallel workflows. The integration language is specific to insurance technology ecosystems (AMS, document management, Outlook) rather than generic SaaS boilerplate — signaling that Qumis understands the actual technology landscape these teams manage. Data isolation language addresses the specific concern insurance IT teams raise about AI tools using their policy data.
