The market for AI in commercial insurance is splitting into two categories: tools that automate insurance workflows and platforms that deliver coverage intelligence. Most vendors — regardless of funding or positioning — fall into the first category: they make existing processes faster without fundamentally changing the quality of coverage analysis. Qumis created and owns the second category. Our competitive frame must reinforce this distinction at every turn.

## The Competitive Landscape

Qumis encounters four competitive alternatives in sales conversations, each requiring a distinct positioning approach:

1. **Workflow automation platforms** (FurtherAI, Fulcrum) — the most frequent head-to-head competitor
2. **Generic AI tools** (ChatGPT, Copilot, internal builds) — the most frequent budget objection
3. **In-house coverage experts and outside counsel** — the incumbent solution for complex coverage questions
4. **Status quo** (manual processes) — the "do nothing" alternative

## vs. Workflow Automation Platforms (FurtherAI, Fulcrum)

| They Say | We Say |
| :---- | :---- |
| "Automate your insurance workflows" | "Understand your coverage at a legal level — and benchmark it against the market" |
| Faster document processing | Deeper document understanding + market intelligence |
| Generic LLM with insurance UI | Purpose-built coverage reasoning engine trained by a licensed attorney |
| Speed and efficiency metrics | Accuracy, insight quality, and defensibility metrics |
| "Eliminate busywork" | "Elevate the quality of every coverage decision" |
| No proprietary data asset | Proprietary database of thousands of commercial programs |

**Competitive Talking Points:**

FurtherAI (a16z-backed) and Fulcrum both raised large rounds in late 2025 competing on workflow automation. We compete on a fundamentally different dimension: legal-grade coverage intelligence that understands what policies actually mean and benchmarks them against real market data. They make document processing faster. We make coverage decisions better.

Workflow platforms excel at submissions intake, data entry, and proposal generation — moving information between systems. Qumis excels at coverage reasoning — understanding policy language, identifying coverage gaps, explaining legal implications, and contextualizing coverage against market standards. Different problems, different solutions. Many of our customers use both: workflow tools for operational speed, Qumis for analytical depth. We are the intelligence layer that makes the entire technology stack smarter.

> **Tip:** **The complementary positioning is strategic, not defensive.** Positioning Qumis alongside workflow tools rather than against them accomplishes three things: it neutralizes the "we already have FurtherAI" objection, it expands the budget conversation (different line item, different value), and it positions Qumis as the higher-value platform in the stack.

### Killer Questions to Expose the Gap

- "Can your AI explain why a pollution exclusion applies differently under occurrence vs. claims-made policies?" — Exposes the legal reasoning gap
- "Can their platform tell you how that exclusion compares to what carriers are writing across comparable programs in your industry?" — Exposes the market intelligence gap. No workflow tool can answer this
- "When your AI identifies a coverage gap, does it cite the specific policy language and explain the legal basis for the conclusion — or just flag a difference?" — Exposes the citation and defensibility gap
- "Who on their founding team is a licensed coverage attorney?" — Exposes the domain expertise gap. Most effective with senior coverage professionals who understand what legal training means for policy interpretation

### Competitor-Specific Notes

> **Warning:** **Internal use only — do not share with prospects.**

- **FurtherAI:** Positions as "AI Workspace for Insurance" with workflow focus on submissions, audits, and claims intake. Founded by ML engineers. Strong on engineering talent and automation speed. Weak on coverage reasoning depth, legal defensibility, and market intelligence. They are building for operations teams; we are building for coverage professionals
- **Fulcrum:** Positions as "Scale your accounts, not your headcount" with full lifecycle automation including AMS integration, proposals, and policy checking. Strong on breadth of workflow coverage. Weak on analytical depth — their "policy checking" is surface-level compliance, not legal-grade coverage analysis with market context

## vs. Generic AI (ChatGPT, etc.)

This is the most common objection your sales team will encounter. It takes three forms, each requiring a different response:

### Form 1: "Why can't we just use ChatGPT?" (The casual dismissal)

**Response framework:** Generic AI hallucinates on insurance questions because it has no domain-specific training, no insurance taxonomies, and no safeguards for when evidence is insufficient. It treats exclusions and conditions identically. It can't cite specific policy language. And it has zero proprietary market data to contextualize its output. Qumis was built by a licensed coverage attorney who encoded legal reasoning frameworks into the platform, backed by a proprietary database of thousands of commercial programs. The gap isn't small — it's structural.

### Form 2: "Our IT team can build something with the API." (The build-vs-buy objection)

**Response framework:** Building a policy analysis tool on top of GPT is straightforward. Building one that delivers legal-grade accuracy with citation-linked outputs, multi-agent validation, insurance-specific taxonomies, and proprietary market benchmarking is a multi-year, multi-million-dollar effort that requires deep insurance domain expertise your IT team doesn't have. Every month you spend building, your competitors are already using Qumis. And you'll never replicate the proprietary data asset — that requires thousands of real commercial programs analyzed over years.

### Form 3: "AI is improving fast — won't this be commoditized?" (The wait-and-see objection)

**Response framework:** Foundation models are improving rapidly — which makes the generic layer more commoditized, not less. What becomes more valuable as generic AI improves is the domain-specific intelligence layer: the legal reasoning frameworks, the insurance taxonomies, the proprietary market data, and the accumulated understanding of how policy language gets interpreted in practice. That's what Qumis is. We ride the improvement curve of foundation models while maintaining the domain expertise and data moat that generic tools can never replicate. The gap doesn't close over time — it widens.

### Key Differentiators (All Forms)

- **Citation-linked outputs:** Every conclusion traces to source policy language. Generic AI provides answers without evidence
- **"I don't know" safeguards:** When evidence is insufficient, Qumis says so. Generic AI confidently hallucinates — which in insurance creates E\&O exposure
- **Insurance taxonomies:** Qumis understands the structural roles of policy provisions (exclusions, conditions, endorsements, definitions). Generic AI treats them as undifferentiated text
- **Proprietary market data:** Qumis benchmarks coverage against thousands of real commercial programs. Generic AI has no proprietary insurance data whatsoever
- **Audit trail:** Qumis creates traceable, defensible documentation suitable for regulatory and litigation scrutiny. Generic AI outputs are ephemeral and untraceable

**Soundbite:** "You wouldn't use ChatGPT for a legal opinion. Why would you trust it with legal contracts worth millions in coverage?"

## vs. Outside Counsel & Coverage Consultants

This competitor is often invisible in the sales process because it's not a software vendor — it's the law firm or coverage consultant the organization already uses for complex coverage questions. But it's the incumbent solution for exactly the use case where Qumis is strongest.

**The Frame:** Qumis doesn't replace outside counsel on genuinely complex disputes or litigation matters. But for the vast majority of coverage questions — the ones that currently generate a $5,000–$10,000 outside counsel invoice and a 2–3 week turnaround — Qumis delivers attorney-grade analysis in hours at a fraction of the cost. Reserve outside counsel for the matters that truly require it. Use Qumis for everything else.

**Key Talking Points:**

- **Economics:** Outside counsel bills $500–$800/hour for coverage analysis. A typical coverage opinion costs $5,000–$10,000 and takes 2–3 weeks. Qumis delivers comparable analysis in hours at a fraction of the cost
- **Speed:** When a claim comes in or a renewal deadline approaches, waiting weeks for outside counsel isn't viable. Qumis provides immediate coverage reasoning that enables faster decisions
- **Built by one of them:** Qumis was built by a licensed insurance coverage attorney who practiced coverage law. The analytical frameworks in the platform are the same ones coverage counsel use — encoded in software that operates at enterprise speed
- **Scale:** Outside counsel doesn't scale. You can't send every coverage question to a law firm. Qumis makes legal-grade analysis available for every policy, every claim, every renewal — not just the ones with enough dollars at stake to justify an outside counsel engagement
- **Complementary, not replacement:** For matters heading to litigation or requiring formal legal opinions, outside counsel remains essential. Qumis handles the 80% of coverage questions that don't require a formal engagement — and provides better-prepared analysis for the 20% that do

**Soundbite:** "Your outside counsel charges $500/hour and takes three weeks. Qumis delivers the same analytical rigor in hours. Save outside counsel for the matters that truly need it."

---

## vs. Status Quo (Manual Processes)

For prospects not yet evaluating AI solutions, the competitor is their current manual process — experienced professionals reading policies, comparing documents side by side, and relying on institutional knowledge.

**The Frame:** Manual coverage analysis works until it doesn't. It's slow, inconsistent across team members, and doesn't scale. Your best coverage people are bottlenecks, and when they leave, their expertise walks out the door. Qumis doesn't replace human judgment — it amplifies it, ensuring every team member operates with the same analytical depth and market context as your most experienced people.

**Key Talking Points:**

- **Consistency:** Manual processes produce different answers from different people on the same policy. Qumis standardizes coverage reasoning without eliminating human judgment
- **Institutional knowledge risk:** Your best coverage people's expertise lives in their heads. Qumis captures and scales that analytical capability across the organization
- **Scale:** Your team can't manually analyze every policy with the same rigor. Some get thorough reviews; others get skimmed. Qumis makes thorough analysis the default, not the exception
- **Market context:** Even your most experienced people can only draw on the programs they've personally seen. Qumis benchmarks against thousands of commercial programs — broader market visibility than any individual can accumulate in a career

**Soundbite:** "Your best coverage person has seen maybe a thousand programs in their career. Qumis has analyzed thousands — and brings that market context to every analysis, for every member of your team."

## Competitive Positioning Summary

| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Counter | Our Unassailable Advantage |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Workflow Platforms | Operational speed, breadth of automation | We're complementary, not competitive — different value, different budget | Legal reasoning + proprietary market data. They can't build this. |
| Generic AI | Low cost, general capability, improving rapidly | Domain expertise, citation architecture, "I don't know" safeguards | Proprietary insurance data and attorney-trained reasoning. The gap widens as generic AI commoditizes. |
| Outside Counsel | Deep expertise, legal defensibility, litigation authority | Same analytical rigor at 10% of the cost and 10x the speed | Scale and speed. Law firms can't serve every coverage question economically. |
| Status Quo | Trusted, proven, no implementation risk | Amplifies human judgment, doesn't replace it; scales expertise across the team | Market intelligence from thousands of programs — broader than any individual's experience. |

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Never disparage competitors by name to prospects.** Reference them by category ("workflow automation tools") unless the prospect brings up a specific vendor
2. **Lead with the complementary frame** for workflow platforms. "We work alongside them" is stronger than "we're better than them" — it neutralizes the objection and elevates your positioning
3. **Use killer questions sparingly and strategically.** They're most effective when a prospect is actively comparing you to a specific competitor, not as an opening move
4. **Always bring it back to market intelligence.** This is the differentiator that ends competitive conversations. No competitor — workflow platform, generic AI, or law firm — has a proprietary database of thousands of commercial insurance programs. When in doubt, land here
5. **Competitor funding is internal context only.** Do not reference competitor funding amounts to prospects — it invites unfavorable comparisons. Your sales team should know the landscape; your prospects should hear about your value
