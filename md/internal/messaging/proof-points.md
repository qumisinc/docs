## Customer Testimonials

### Coverage Expertise & Accuracy

**Tom Hanekamp** — Senior Partner, Cruser Mitchell (Coverage Counsel)

> "I tested it with real-world coverage disputes, and it consistently delivered thoughtful, well-reasoned responses."

*Context: Uses Qumis daily for coverage opinions. Also originated the "first-year associate" comparison and tested Qumis against ChatGPT on a racial discrimination exclusion analysis — Qumis got the coverage position correct where ChatGPT failed.*
*Best for: Claims messaging, competitive differentiation vs. generic AI, credibility with coverage professionals*

**Connor Love** — National Director of Growth, IMA Financial

> "At first, I thought, 'There's no way this will catch everything.' But after using it on layered programs and seeing it track discrepancies I might have missed, I was sold."

*Context: 300+ policies analyzed in first 90 days at IMA.*
*Best for: Producer/front office messaging, skeptic conversion, layered program complexity proof point*

### Operational Efficiency & ROI

**Brian Pilarski** — SVP & Partner, Kapnick

> "Qumis makes our policy reviews faster, sharper, and more accurate — it's a no-brainer. We cut our policy review time in half and eliminated the need for an additional hire."

*Context: Team of 20 using Qumis since Q1 2025. Kapnick has the highest per-user engagement of any Qumis account (718 average engagement score).*
*Best for: Account manager messaging, brokerage executive ROI conversations, headcount/efficiency proof point*

**Brandon M.** — Senior Claims Advocate, Top 5 Broker (anonymized)

> "Without Qumis, my caseload would be overwhelming. This isn't about working faster — it changed what's possible in my job."

*Context: Source of the 8x faster, +33% capacity, and $1.8M recovery metrics.*
*Best for: Claims messaging, capacity/scale proof point, "not just faster — fundamentally different" positioning*

### Trust & Reliability

**Vance Woods** — Senior Claims Adjuster, Skyward Specialty

> "What I would normally have to spend a couple hours on, I can condense into 30 minutes or less. It helps narrow down and logically note the file in terms of how you arrive at a decision or conclusion. The consistency's there — it's stable."

*Context: Inland marine/cargo claims specialist. Saved $21,000 on a single claim when Qumis identified a reefer exclusion buried in a 1,000-page policy that he had missed. The Vance story is one of the most compelling claims narratives — he was already negotiating a settlement at 70 cents on the dollar before Qumis caught the exclusion.*
*Best for: Claims messaging, accuracy/defensibility proof point, the "what you're missing" argument*

**Joanne Snow** — Senior Claims Technical Director, Skyward Specialty (D\&O/Management Liability)

> "I use it as a checklist to make sure I'm looking at everything I need to. It gives you a second pair of eyes — it confirms what you're thinking, or flags areas you need to look at. For these D\&O claims with so many nuances, I think it's helpful for that."

*Context: Experienced claims professional who positions Qumis as a validation tool, not a replacement. This framing is critical for credibility with senior coverage professionals who are skeptical of AI doing their job.*
*Best for: Claims messaging to senior/skeptical practitioners, "second pair of eyes" positioning, D\&O/specialty lines proof point*

**Daniel Berkowitz** — Partner, Cruser Mitchell (Coverage Counsel)

Value articulation: "$150/month vs. associate salary"

*Context: Confirmed the first-year associate comparison with Hanekamp. The $150/month vs. first-year associate salary framing is a powerful ROI anchor for coverage counsel conversations.*
*Best for: Outside counsel ROI comparison, law firm sales conversations*

## Credibility Markers

### Founding Team

1. **Dan Schuleman, Esq.** — Co-Founder & CEO. Licensed insurance coverage attorney with law firm and in-house experience. This is the single most important credibility marker in the entire company — it backs the "attorney-trained AI" claim with a real person, not a marketing phrase
2. **Shiv Sinha** — Co-Founder & CTO. Former Head of Application Development at Goldman Sachs; led development of Marcus, Goldman's consumer banking platform. Establishes technical credibility at enterprise scale

> **Tip:** The attorney + enterprise tech founder combination is rare and should be referenced frequently. "Founded by a coverage attorney and the former head of application development at Goldman Sachs" is a one-sentence credibility anchor.

### Institutional Validation

1. **SOC 2 Type I certified** — enterprise-grade security and compliance
2. **$6.5M total funding** — $2.2M pre-seed; $4.3M oversubscribed seed round led by MTech Capital with American Family Ventures as new strategic investor and participation from all prior investors
3. **Selected for FinTech Innovation Lab New York** — top 3% of applicants. The program is run by the Partnership Fund for New York City and Accenture, with mentorship from senior executives at leading financial institutions
4. **Oversubscribed pre-seed and seed rounds** — demand exceeded allocation, signaling strong investor conviction

> **Info:** **Funding narrative:** MTech Capital is an insurtech-focused fund; American Family Ventures is the venture arm of American Family Insurance, one of the largest P\&C insurers in the US. The combination of specialist insurtech investors and strategic P\&C capital validates both the technology thesis and the market opportunity.

### Product & Technology

1. **Proprietary database of 10,000+ commercial insurance policies** across major lines of business — this is the data moat that competitors cannot replicate
2. **Multi-agent AI architecture** — specialized AI agents read, validate, and cross-reference documents, mirroring actual legal review processes
3. **Citation-linked outputs** — every conclusion traces to source policy language, creating auditable, defensible analysis
4. **"I don't know" safeguards** — the platform explicitly flags insufficient evidence rather than hallucinating, a critical trust differentiator in a profession where overconfident wrong answers create liability
5. **QumisScore** — proprietary coverage quality scoring that benchmarks policies against market standards

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: "The $21,000 Exclusion" — Vance Woods, Skyward Specialty

**Situation:** A cargo claim comes in. The insured's broker is calling every other day pushing for resolution. Vance's initial assessment: the claim is covered. He begins negotiating a settlement at 70 cents on the dollar.

**What he missed:** Buried in a 1,000-page policy was a reefer exclusion. The claim was based on temperature malfunction of the refrigeration unit — squarely within the exclusion. No coverage. But manually clicking through 1,000 pages under deadline pressure? He didn't catch it.

**What Qumis found:** When Vance ran the policy through Qumis, it identified the exclusion immediately. He generated a position letter citing the exact policy language. The broker's own investigation confirmed no coverage. Claim denied. File closed. $21,000 saved on a single claim.

> "The worst thing is a call from underwriting saying, 'Did you not see that exclusion?' After a while, the company will tell you to take your equipment and go."

*Best for: Claims sales conversations, live demo narrative, conference presentations. This story is visceral — it's about job security, not just efficiency.*

### Case Study 2: "The Capacity Transformation" — Brandon M., Top 5 Regional Broker

**Situation:** Senior claims advocate managing hundreds of active claims across complex verticals at a top-5 US brokerage. Caseload is at capacity. Adding staff would take months and $150K+ in salary.

**Impact with Qumis:**

1. Policy review time: 8x faster (hours to 5–10 minutes)
2. Claims response time: 7x faster (~1 week to same/next day)
3. Claims capacity: +33% (150 to 200 claims/month)
4. Additional claim recovery: $1.8M in a single month
5. Headcount impact: Eliminated need for additional hire

> "Without Qumis, my caseload would be overwhelming. This isn't about working faster — it changed what's possible in my job."

*Best for: Claims leadership ROI conversations, board presentations, investor deck. The $1.8M recovery number is the single most powerful ROI data point in the entire Qumis story.*

### Case Study 3: "Land and Expand" — NFP

**Situation:** NFP, a top-15 US brokerage, began with a 50-seat pilot in Q2 2025 focused on the middle-market team.

**Expansion trajectory:** Within months, the deployment expanded to 250+ production users and extended into NFP's construction practice group in Q4 2025. This represents the land-and-expand motion that drives 127% NRR.

**What this proves:** Enterprise insurance organizations don't just try Qumis — they deploy it broadly once they see results. The expansion from middle-market to construction practice demonstrates cross-practice-group utility and internal champion advocacy.

*Best for: Brokerage executive conversations ("this is what adoption looks like at organizations your size"), investor deck, competitive positioning.*
