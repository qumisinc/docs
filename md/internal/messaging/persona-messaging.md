This section focuses on the day-to-day practitioners who will use Qumis. Each persona has distinct pain points, priorities, and value drivers that require tailored messaging to drive adoption and internal advocacy. Where [Audience Messaging](/internal/messaging/audience-messaging) addresses why decision-makers should buy Qumis, this section addresses why practitioners will champion and use it.

## Front Office / Producers

**Primary Value Proposition**

Qumis gives you a coverage advantage your competitors don't have. In minutes, you'll deliver legal-grade coverage analysis backed by market intelligence from thousands of commercial programs — presenting data-driven insights that differentiate your proposals and win accounts. While your competitors walk in with generic comparisons, you'll show prospects exactly how their coverage stacks up against the market and where the gaps are, with citations to prove it.

### Key Benefits

- **Market-informed proposals:** Show prospects how their coverage compares not just to their expiring, but to what you're seeing across comparable programs in their industry. That's a fundamentally different conversation than "I reviewed your policy."
- **Competitive differentiation:** Present detailed coverage comparisons that expose gaps in incumbent programs with market context, demonstrating value prospects can't get from any other broker
- **Revenue acceleration:** Close more deals by answering complex coverage questions instantly with citation-linked analysis, keeping prospects engaged instead of waiting days for your team to get back to them
- **Client confidence from day one:** Citation-linked analysis backed by market benchmarks shows you've done deeper homework than anyone else. You're not making claims — you're showing data
- **More selling, less researching:** Focus time on building relationships and closing deals instead of wading through policy documents or waiting on coverage teams to produce analysis

### Pain Points We Solve

- **Inability to demonstrate differentiated value quickly:** Without market data and legal-grade analysis to back up your recommendations, you're just another broker making claims. Prospects need proof, not promises — and your experienced competitors have deep institutional knowledge you need to match
- **Slow sales cycles:** Manual policy reviews create bottlenecks that kill momentum in competitive situations. Prospects go cold waiting for coverage analysis that your coverage team is producing manually
- **Lack of competitive intelligence:** You can't expose gaps in the incumbent program if you can't quickly analyze their current coverage against market standards. Generic comparisons don't win business; market-informed ones do
- **Real-time information gap:** In client meetings, you need instant answers to coverage questions. Saying "I'll get back to you" erodes confidence and gives competitors an opening

### Proof Points

- **80% faster policy reviews:** NFP producers reduced complex policy review time by 80%, freeing time for client-facing activity
- **Market benchmarking:** Coverage comparisons contextualized against thousands of commercial programs across major lines of business
- **Citation-backed proposals:** Every recommendation links directly to policy language — show prospects exactly where coverage gaps exist
- **Built by attorneys:** Developed by a licensed coverage attorney who understands exactly what it takes to evaluate coverage and win business on expertise

### Suggested Talk Tracks

### When competing against workflow platforms

"Those platforms are great for speeding up proposals and data entry — that's table stakes. But when you're sitting across from a prospect and they ask 'How does my coverage compare to what you're seeing in the market?' you need real coverage intelligence, not just faster document processing. Qumis gives you the answer that wins the business — legal-grade analysis backed by market data from thousands of commercial programs, with citations you can show them on the spot. That's the competitive advantage that matters."

### Cold open for producer conversations

"I know your time is valuable, and you need to walk into prospect meetings with something your competitors can't match. Qumis gives you instant, legal-grade analysis on any policy — I can show you coverage gaps and market benchmarking backed by actual policy language, right here in our meeting. You'll show prospects how their program stacks up against comparable accounts in their industry. Let me pull up a program and show you what I mean."

## Back Office / Account Managers

**Primary Value Proposition**

Qumis makes you the most knowledgeable person on your client's coverage program. Instead of spending your days extracting data from policy documents, you'll have structured intelligence at your fingertips — with the market context to proactively identify coverage gaps, flag renewal risks, and provide the kind of strategic guidance that makes clients see you as an indispensable partner, not a service coordinator.

### Key Benefits

- **Proactive client advisor:** Surface coverage gaps and market insights at renewal — "Based on what we're seeing across comparable programs, here are three areas where your client's coverage has fallen behind market standard." That's strategic account management, not just policy processing
- **Confidence on every client call:** Citation-linked analysis means you never have to guess or hedge on a coverage question. When a client calls about a specific exclusion, you have the answer — backed by source policy language
- **Operational efficiency:** Slash the time spent on policy reviews, coverage summaries, and renewal preparation from hours to minutes per task. Structured data extraction eliminates manual copy-paste and the typos that come with it
- **Error reduction:** Citation-linked outputs eliminate the risk of missing critical exclusions or misreading endorsements — no more corrections to clients, no more E\&O anxiety
- **Handle renewals without the panic:** Manage growing books of business without working weekends or the 2 AM realization that you missed something in a 200-page program

### Pain Points We Solve

- **Reactive instead of strategic:** You spend your days responding to urgent requests instead of proactively strengthening client relationships. You know you should be surfacing renewal insights and coverage recommendations, but there's never enough time
- **Manual data extraction burden:** Hours spent pulling policy details, limits, deductibles, and endorsements from PDFs into summaries and spreadsheets — tedious work that's also the most error-prone part of your job
- **No market context for renewals:** You can tell a client what their policy says, but you can't tell them how it compares to what similar organizations are buying. That market insight is what separates strategic advisors from service teams
- **Coverage questions that stump you:** When a client asks about a specific endorsement interaction or whether an exclusion applies to their situation, you either guess, escalate, or say "I'll get back to you." All three erode confidence
- **Firefighting vs. strategic work:** Your days are consumed by the urgent instead of the important. Every hour you spend on manual policy extraction is an hour you're not spending on the client relationship work that actually drives retention

### Proof Points

- **Structured data extraction:** Qumis automatically pulls policy details into organized, searchable formats — no more copy-paste or typos
- **Market intelligence:** Benchmark client coverage against comparable programs to proactively identify gaps and strengthen renewal conversations
- **Document Vault:** Centralized repository for all client policies — instant access for the entire team, no more hunting through shared drives
- **Prompt Library:** Team-wide consistency on coverage workflows — everyone delivers the same quality, reducing training burden
- **User testimonial:** "It made our policy reviews faster, sharper, and more accurate while eliminating the need for an additional hire — it's a no-brainer." — Senior account manager at a top-15 brokerage

> **Info:** **Integration note:** Qumis is designed to work within the tools you already use — integrating with your email workflow through Outlook and connecting to document management systems like SharePoint and Box. You don't need to change how you work; Qumis fits into your existing process.

### Suggested Talk Tracks

### When competing against workflow platforms

"Workflow platforms are excellent for proposal generation and AMS data entry — they save you hours on admin work. But when a client calls asking about a specific exclusion, or why their claim might not be covered, or how their coverage compares to the market, you need more than automated data extraction. You need to actually understand the policy and its context. Qumis gives you the coverage intelligence to answer confidently, with citations you can share and market benchmarks to back you up."

### Cold open for AM conversations

"I know you're juggling dozens of accounts and every policy request feels urgent. What if you could walk into your next renewal meeting not just with the policy analysis, but with market insights showing how your client's coverage stacks up against comparable programs? Qumis handles the heavy lifting — extracting data, identifying gaps, benchmarking against the market — so you can focus on the strategic conversations that keep clients loyal. Let me show you what a renewal prep looks like with Qumis."

## Claims Professionals

**Primary Value Proposition**

Qumis accelerates claims resolution while strengthening your coverage position. When a claim arrives, you'll instantly understand the applicable coverage, identify relevant exclusions and endorsements, and build defensible positions backed by citation-linked analysis and market intelligence. Instead of days spent manually reviewing policies and researching coverage questions, you'll deliver faster, more confident determinations with documentation that holds up under scrutiny.

### Key Benefits

- **Faster cycle times:** Coverage analysis that took days now takes hours — accelerating claims resolution and getting to the right answer before deadline pressure forces a rushed decision
- **Improved accuracy:** Citation-linked analysis ensures you never miss a critical exclusion or misinterpret an endorsement during coverage determination. Every relevant provision is surfaced, not just the ones you happened to find
- **Market-informed coverage positions:** Contextualize your coverage determinations against how similar provisions are structured across thousands of commercial programs — strengthening reservation-of-rights letters and coverage positions with market data, not just policy language
- **Defensible documentation:** Citation-backed coverage determinations create audit trails that withstand scrutiny from insureds, regulators, and bad-faith plaintiffs. Your reasoning is documented, sourced, and replicable
- **Identify coverage defenses comprehensively:** Surface every applicable exclusion, limitation, and condition — including the ones that get overlooked under deadline pressure — to build the strongest defensible position on every file

### Pain Points We Solve

- **Manual policy review bottlenecks:** Each claim requires hours of reading through policies, endorsements, and exclusions before you can make coverage determinations — and the more complex the program, the more likely something gets missed
- **Inconsistent handling across the team:** Different adjusters interpret the same policy language differently, creating exposure to bad-faith claims and regulatory scrutiny. There's no standardized approach to coverage reasoning
- **Missed coverage defenses under pressure:** Under deadline pressure, it's easy to overlook a relevant exclusion or limitation that could have reduced or eliminated indemnity exposure. You find out when the file gets reviewed — or worse, in litigation
- **No market context for coverage positions:** You know what the policy says, but you don't know how the provision compares to standard market language. That context strengthens your position — or tells you when a coverage argument is on shaky ground
- **Outside counsel dependency:** Complex coverage questions get sent to outside counsel at $500–$800/hour when they could be resolved internally with the right analytical tools. Every referral is a budget line item and a cycle time delay

### Proof Points

- **Attorney-trained AI:** Built by a licensed coverage attorney who understands exactly how coverage determinations get challenged — and what it takes to build positions that hold up
- **Complex coverage analysis in hours, not days:** Instant access to all relevant policy provisions, exclusions, and endorsements for any claim scenario
- **Market intelligence:** Benchmark policy provisions against comparable programs to understand whether your coverage position is on solid or contested ground
- **User testimonial:** "After using it on layered programs and seeing it find discrepancies I missed, I was sold." — Claims professional at a top-15 brokerage

> **Info:** **Claims personas note:** Claims professionals sit on both sides of the table — carrier-side adjusters making coverage determinations and broker-side claims advocates arguing for coverage on behalf of their clients. Tailor the messaging accordingly:
>
> - **Carrier-side adjusters:** Emphasize accuracy, defensibility, consistency, and loss ratio impact. They need to make the right call and document it.
> - **Broker-side claims advocates:** Emphasize finding every basis for coverage, building the strongest position for the insured, and reducing reliance on outside counsel. They need to argue persuasively.
>
> Both benefit from the same underlying capability — legal-grade coverage reasoning — but the framing should reflect their opposing objectives.

> **Info:** **Integration note:** Qumis works alongside your existing claims management system and email workflow. Coverage analysis can be initiated directly from your inbox and results integrated into your existing documentation process — no new system to learn, no disruption to your current workflow.

### Suggested Talk Tracks

### When competing against workflow platforms

"Workflow platforms excel at claims intake and data extraction — routing files and pulling information from forms. That's valuable for volume. But when you need to make an actual coverage determination — whether an exclusion applies, how endorsements interact, what your exposure is — that requires legal-grade policy reasoning, not document processing. Qumis was built by a coverage attorney specifically for these decisions. Many claims teams use workflow tools for intake and Qumis for the actual coverage analysis."

### Cold open for claims conversations

"When a complex claim comes in, every hour matters — for the insured and for your exposure. Qumis instantly analyzes the policy and surfaces every relevant coverage provision, exclusion, and endorsement, then lets you benchmark those provisions against market standards. You get citation-backed coverage determinations in hours instead of days, with the documentation to defend your position. Let me show you how it works on a complex program."
