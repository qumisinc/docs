This section arms your team for the hardest moments in sales conversations. Each objection includes the initial response, the most likely follow-up, and the response to that follow-up. Objections rarely end after one exchange — prepare for the conversation, not just the question.

> **Info:** **Principles for all objection handling:**
>
> 1. **Acknowledge before countering.** Dismissing a prospect's concern makes them defensive. Validating it builds trust
> 2. **Lead with Qumis, not competitors.** Spend more time on what you are than what they aren't
> 3. **Land on market intelligence when possible.** The proprietary data asset is the argument that ends objection conversations
> 4. **Use proof points.** Abstract claims are forgettable. Specific customer stories are persuasive

## The 10 Objections

### Objection 1: "How is this different from ChatGPT?"

*This is the most common objection. It takes multiple forms depending on who's asking.*

**Initial Response:** Qumis is a purpose-built coverage intelligence platform — built by a licensed coverage attorney, trained on insurance-specific reasoning frameworks, and backed by a proprietary database of thousands of real commercial insurance programs. Every output is citation-linked to the source policy language, so you can verify any conclusion. And when the evidence is ambiguous or insufficient, Qumis tells you — it says "I don't know" rather than guessing. That's not how ChatGPT works. Generic AI has no insurance domain expertise, no proprietary data, no citation architecture, and no safeguards against confident wrong answers. In insurance, a confident wrong answer creates liability.

**Follow-up: "But ChatGPT is free / much cheaper. Isn't it good enough for most tasks?"**

For basic document search, maybe. But coverage analysis isn't basic document search — it requires understanding how exclusions interact with definitions, how endorsements modify coverage, and how sublimits affect recovery. ChatGPT treats a policy as undifferentiated text. Qumis understands the structural roles of every provision. And here's the part generic AI can never replicate: Qumis benchmarks coverage against thousands of real commercial programs. When Qumis identifies a coverage gap, it can tell you how that gap compares to what carriers are writing across comparable programs in your industry. ChatGPT has no proprietary insurance data whatsoever.

**Follow-up: "AI is improving fast. Won't GPT-5 or GPT-6 solve this?"**

Foundation models are improving rapidly — which actually makes our position stronger, not weaker. As generic AI gets better, the *generic* layer commoditizes. What becomes more valuable is the domain-specific intelligence layer: the legal reasoning frameworks, the insurance taxonomies, the proprietary market data accumulated from thousands of real programs, and the understanding of how policy language gets interpreted in practice. That's what Qumis is. We ride the improvement curve of foundation models while maintaining the domain expertise and data moat that generic tools can never replicate. The gap doesn't close over time — it widens.

### Objection 2: "We already have \[workflow automation tool]"

**Initial Response:** That's actually a great foundation. Workflow tools like that are strong at operational efficiency — submissions intake, data movement, document processing. Qumis does something different: we deliver coverage intelligence — understanding what the policy actually means, identifying coverage gaps, and benchmarking coverage against market standards. Think of it this way: your workflow tool can tell you two policies are different. Qumis tells you what those differences mean for coverage and how they compare to what the rest of the market is writing. Many of our customers use both — the workflow tool for operational speed, Qumis for analytical depth. We're the intelligence layer that makes the entire stack smarter.

**Follow-up: "That sounds like we'd be paying for two tools that overlap."**

Different budget, different value, different users. Your workflow tool serves operations teams processing high volumes of documents. Qumis serves coverage professionals — the people who need to understand, interpret, and defend policy positions. There's almost no user overlap. And the ROI model is completely different: workflow tools save time on administrative tasks. Qumis prevents coverage errors, identifies gaps your team might miss, and provides the market context that supports better coverage decisions. One of our customers — a senior claims advocate at a top-5 broker — recovered an additional $1.8M in claims in a single month using Qumis. That's not an efficiency gain. That's a revenue outcome no workflow tool delivers.

### Objection 3: "How do I know I can trust the AI output?"

**Initial Response:** This is exactly the right question, and it's why we built Qumis the way we did. Three things make Qumis output trustworthy in a way generic AI is not. First, every conclusion is citation-linked to the source policy language — you click any finding and see exactly which provision it came from. Second, we built "I don't know" safeguards into the system on purpose. When the evidence is ambiguous or a document is unclear, Qumis flags it rather than guessing. In insurance, a confidently wrong answer is worse than no answer at all. Third, Qumis creates an auditable documentation trail — analysis that's traceable, defensible, and suitable for regulatory or litigation scrutiny.

**Follow-up: "But how accurate is it really? What's your error rate?"**

We don't publish a single accuracy number because accuracy varies by policy type, complexity, and use case — and anyone who gives you a single percentage is oversimplifying. What we can tell you is this: one of our users — a senior claims adjuster at a specialty carrier — told us Qumis caught a reefer exclusion buried in a 1,000-page policy that he had missed. He was already negotiating a settlement. That single catch saved $21,000 on one claim. And a senior claims technical director at the same carrier described Qumis as a "second pair of eyes" that "confirms what you're thinking, or flags areas you need to look at." The trust architecture isn't about a percentage — it's about citations, safeguards, and the ability to verify everything the system tells you.

### Objection 4: "Is this going to replace my team?"

**Initial Response:** No — and we designed it that way deliberately. Qumis is a force multiplier for your existing team, not a replacement. Your senior coverage professionals still make the decisions, still exercise judgment, still manage client relationships. What Qumis does is make sure every member of your team operates with the same analytical depth and market context as your most experienced people. Think of it as giving each person on your team a tireless coverage expert who has already read the entire policy and analyzed it against thousands of comparable programs — so your people can focus on the judgment calls that actually require their expertise.

**Follow-up: "My team is worried about this. How do I get buy-in?"**

The practitioners who are most skeptical upfront often become the strongest advocates. One of our users, Joanne Snow — a Senior Claims Technical Director at Skyward Specialty who handles complex D\&O and management liability claims — put it this way: "I use it as a checklist to make sure I'm looking at everything I need to. It gives you a second pair of eyes — confirms what you're thinking, or flags areas you need to look at." That's how experienced professionals actually use Qumis — not as a replacement for their expertise, but as a tool that makes their expertise more thorough and consistent. The best way to build buy-in is a focused pilot with your most demanding team members. When your toughest critics see Qumis catch something they missed on their own policies, adoption follows naturally.

### Objection 5: "What about security and compliance?"

**Initial Response:** We're SOC 2 Type I certified and built specifically for enterprise insurance deployment. Three things that matter most for your security review: client data is never used for AI model training — your policies stay your policies. We maintain strict data isolation between tenants — no client can access another client's data. And we provide enterprise-grade access controls including SSO and MFA. Multiple top 15 U.S. brokerages put us through their full security review process and approved us for production use with their most sensitive policy documents.

**Follow-up: "We need to run this through our InfoSec team. What does that look like?"**

We've been through rigorous security reviews with major enterprise brokerages and can provide your InfoSec team with our SOC 2 report, security questionnaire responses, and architecture documentation. Typical security reviews take two to four weeks. We're happy to schedule a technical call with your security team directly — our CTO has led enterprise security implementations at Goldman Sachs and can speak their language.

### Objection 6: "How long does implementation take?"

**Initial Response:** Most teams are productive within days. Qumis is cloud-based — no on-premise installation, no complex integration required. You upload policies and start analyzing them. There's no heavy IT lift, which is why our typical implementation timeline is days to weeks, not months. For teams wanting deeper integration with existing systems — AMS platforms like Applied Epic or Sagitta, document management systems, email workflows — we have APIs and can scope a phased rollout.

**Follow-up: "What does the rollout typically look like?"**

Most customers start with a focused deployment — a specific practice group, a specific use case like renewals or claims analysis — and expand as they see results. That's how NFP went from a 50-seat pilot focused on their middle-market team to 250+ production users across multiple practice groups including construction. We provide hands-on onboarding, training tailored to your team's workflows, and ongoing customer success support. The goal is time to value in the first week, measurable impact in the first month.

### Objection 7: "We tried \[other AI tool] and it didn't work"

**Initial Response:** That's a common experience, and frankly it's why many of our best customers came to us — they were burned by generic AI that doesn't understand insurance. Most AI tools applied to insurance are either general-purpose models with an insurance interface or workflow automation tools that don't attempt real coverage analysis. Qumis is neither. Our founder is a licensed coverage attorney who experienced the failures of generic AI on real coverage questions and built Qumis specifically to solve what those tools couldn't. The reasoning frameworks in the platform are the same ones coverage counsel use — encoded in software, backed by a proprietary database of thousands of real commercial programs.

**Follow-up: "How do I know this time will be different?"**

Two things. First, let us show you on your actual policies. We'll run a pilot on your documents, not a demo on ours. When you see Qumis accurately analyze a layered program or identify a coverage gap in a policy you know well, you'll see the difference immediately. Second, ask us the hard questions — not simple policy lookups, but the nuanced coverage questions that tripped up whatever tool you used before. We had a user — Connor Love, National Director of Growth at IMA — who told us he initially thought "There's no way this will catch everything." After using it on layered programs and seeing it track discrepancies he might have missed, he was sold. Let your skeptics put us to the test. That's how we win.

### Objection 8: "This is too expensive" / "We don't have the budget"

**Initial Response:** I understand — let me reframe what you're actually comparing against. The alternative to Qumis isn't free. It's the cost of the manual process: your most experienced people spending hours on policy reviews that Qumis handles in minutes. It's the coverage gap that gets missed because there wasn't time for a thorough review. It's the outside counsel engagement at $500 to $800 an hour for a coverage question Qumis could have answered immediately. One of our customers, Brian Pilarski at Kapnick, told us Qumis eliminated the need for an additional hire while making their reviews faster and more accurate. That single hire would have cost significantly more than Qumis across a full team.

**Follow-up: "Can we start smaller?"**

Absolutely — that's exactly how most of our enterprise customers deploy. Start with a focused team of 10 to 20 users on a specific use case. Measure the impact over 90 days. Then expand based on results. That's the motion that drove NFP from 50 seats to 250+ and gives us 127% net revenue retention across our customer base. We're confident enough in the value that we want you to prove it to yourself before scaling.

### Objection 9: "Our IT team can build this internally"

**Initial Response:** Building a document chat interface on top of a foundation model is straightforward — your team could have that running in weeks. But that's not what Qumis is. Building a platform that delivers legal-grade coverage analysis with citation-linked outputs, multi-agent validation, insurance-specific taxonomies, "I don't know" safeguards, and proprietary market benchmarking drawn from thousands of real commercial programs — that's a multi-year, multi-million-dollar effort that requires deep insurance domain expertise your engineering team doesn't have. And there's one thing you can never build internally: the proprietary data asset. That requires thousands of real commercial programs analyzed over years of enterprise customer relationships.

**Follow-up: "We have insurance domain experts who could guide the build."**

Domain experts are critical — and they should be the ones using Qumis, not spending their time as product managers for an internal AI project. Every month your team spends building, your competitors are already using coverage intelligence to win accounts and identify gaps. The question isn't whether your team *could* build something — it's whether that's the highest-value use of your most expensive people's time, and whether you can reach the level of accuracy, market data, and coverage reasoning that Qumis delivers today.

### Objection 10: "We need to see it work on our policies first"

*Note: This is a buying signal, not a true objection. Treat it as forward momentum.*

**Response:** That's exactly how we prefer to start. Generic demos on sample policies don't prove anything. Let's set up a focused pilot on your actual documents — the policies your team knows best — so you can evaluate the analysis against your own expertise. Most pilots run two to four weeks with a defined scope: a specific practice group, a specific line of business, or a specific use case like renewals or claims analysis. Our customer success team provides hands-on onboarding and is available throughout. When your team sees Qumis accurately analyze the policies they've spent years learning, the conversation changes.
