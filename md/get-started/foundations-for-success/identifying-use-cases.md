## Why It Matters

Teams that use Qumis successfully don't just "try AI" — they use it **intentionally**. They choose specific workflows, set clear expectations, and measure progress. This ensures the technology becomes an integral part of how they work rather than an experiment on the side.

The most successful users of Qumis include:

- **Producers and Brokers** who quickly understand what coverage their prospects have
- **Account Managers and Service Teams** who analyze and manage policy changes
- **Claims Professionals** who advocate for clients using clear, defensible policy interpretations

## Step-by-Step Framework for Identifying AI Use Cases

### Step 1: Map Your Workflow

Start by mapping out where your team spends most of its time. The goal is to find **document-heavy, repetitive tasks** that require judgment — the kind of work Qumis is built for.

**How to do it:**

### List your daily activities

For example, reviewing submissions, quoting, checking renewals, managing claims, or responding to client inquiries.

### Identify the document types

Note which documents you handle at each stage (quotes, policies, endorsements, contracts, COIs, complaints, etc.).

### Find pain points

Ask: "Where do we lose the most time or make the most errors?" Those are ideal starting points for AI.

Below is a guide showing how each workflow stage connects with a Qumis feature:

| Workflow Stage         | What It Means                                            | Qumis Feature                        | Value You'll See                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prospecting**        | Reviewing a prospect's current coverage                  | **Chat with Documents**              | Understand coverage faster and prepare smarter conversations with prospects          |
| **Quote Analysis**     | Comparing carrier quotes, binders, and submissions       | **Compare Documents**                | Identify key differences, exclusions, or advantages instantly                        |
| **Policy Checking**    | Reviewing policies for accuracy and completeness         | **Single Policy Analysis**           | Catch missing coverages and verify details before binding                            |
| **Account Management** | Managing ongoing client policies, endorsements, and COIs | **Contract Review & Coverage Table** | Ensure compliance, track requirements, and simplify renewals                         |
| **Claim Advocacy**     | Supporting clients through a claim                       | **Claims Analysis**                  | Analyze coverage for specific claim scenarios and provide defensible recommendations |

> **Tip:** Start with one stage (for example, prospecting or policy checking) and expand after your team gains confidence.

### Step 2: Prioritize by Impact and Effort

Once you've mapped your workflows, prioritize them using a simple two-by-two matrix:

|                 | **Easy to Implement**                                                               | **Harder to Implement**                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Impact** | Start here — these are your "quick wins" (e.g., quote comparisons, policy checking) | Plan next — large or complex processes (e.g., claim advocacy) |
| **Low Impact**  | Optional — automate only if time allows                                             | Avoid — minimal business benefit                              |

To evaluate impact, ask:

- Does this process happen frequently?
- Does it involve high-value clients or decisions?
- Would faster or more accurate results make a difference to customers or revenue?

### Step 3: Define What Success Looks Like

Before starting a pilot, choose **metrics** that help you measure improvement.

**How to set them:**

### Establish a baseline

Record how long a task takes now or how many documents are reviewed per week.

### Pick 2-3 key metrics

Such as:

- Time saved per document or per process
- Reduction in missed items or errors
- Faster turnaround on client deliverables
- Reduction in external legal or review costs

### Measure again after 30-45 days

You'll be able to see the real-world impact of Qumis.

**Example:**

> "Before Qumis, comparing three quotes took 3 hours. After introducing Qumis, it takes less than 30 minutes with improved accuracy."

---

### Step 4: Set Clear Roles and Governance

AI should enhance human expertise — not replace it.

**When rolling out Qumis:**

- **Producers and Brokers:** Use Qumis for initial document review and coverage insight before advising clients.
- **Account Managers and Service Teams:** Use Qumis to verify details, maintain consistency, and manage renewals.
- **Claims Professionals:** Use Qumis for coverage interpretation and defensible claim advocacy.

**To ensure long-term success:**

### Create review checkpoints

Have a team lead review outputs weekly during the first month.

### Use consistent prompts

Build a shared prompt library inside Qumis (e.g., "Summarize differences in property coverage between these quotes").

### Refine your approach

Use Qumis' *Custom Reports* and *Vault* features to document what works and share it across the team.
