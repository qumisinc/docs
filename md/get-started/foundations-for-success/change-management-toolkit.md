title: "Change Management Toolkit"
---

> **Info:** Implementing Qumis isn't about replacing professional judgment — it's about **amplifying it**. Our platform is designed for the top minds in insurance, delivering attorney-trained AI to help your experts fuse their hard-won experience with legal-grade reasoning to deliver value faster and with greater precision.
>
> This playbook blends the **ADKAR change model** with **insurance-specific enablement tools**, practical training materials, and templates for leadership, compliance, and measurement. It's written for organizations where expertise, tradition, and accountability matter — and where adoption succeeds only when people trust both the process and the product.

---

## The ADKAR Framework

**ADKAR** is the foundation for successful change:

1. **Awareness** – Understand why change is needed
2. **Desire** – Build motivation to support it
3. **Knowledge** – Learn how to make it happen
4. **Ability** – Apply new behaviors in real work
5. **Reinforcement** – Sustain and expand adoption

Each phase is paired with practical templates, exercises, and tools in this guide.

---

## Step 0: Assess Readiness & Define Success

Before communicating the change, leadership must align on the goals and assess the organization's readiness. A clear starting point and destination are critical for success.

### Leadership Alignment Checklist

Use these questions to confirm strategic alignment before kickoff:

- Have we clearly identified the top 2-3 business problems Qumis will solve (e.g., proposal speed, error reduction, renewal efficiency)?
- Have we defined the 3-5 key metrics that will define a successful pilot?
- Is the executive sponsor prepared to dedicate at least 2 hours per month to champion this initiative?
- Have we used the **Value Tracker Pack** (see Step 4) to capture our *current* "before" metrics?

### The "Before" State Snapshot

Use the **Value Tracker Pack** to baseline your current metrics *before* the project begins. This transforms the tracker from a historical record into a proactive business case tool, clearly demonstrating ROI later.

---

## Step 1: Build Awareness

### Purpose

Help everyone understand **why** Qumis is being introduced and what challenges it solves.

### How to Build Awareness

### Deliver a leadership message

Link Qumis to real pain points with a clear message from leadership.

### Show before-and-after visuals

Demonstrate **Expert Review vs. Expert + Qumis Review** to illustrate the value.

### Address security questions head-on

Communicate that Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified** and that **client data is always private and never used for AI training**.

### Host 'Why Qumis?' sessions

Invite discussion and feedback to build understanding and buy-in.

### Communication Template

| Item               | Description              | Example                                                                                                          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**           | What to communicate      | "Qumis cuts manual policy reviews by 60%, freeing our best minds for client strategy."                           |
| **Audience**       | Who needs to hear it     | Producers, brokers, account managers, claims teams                                                               |
| **Messenger**      | Who delivers the message | Executive sponsor and direct managers                                                                            |
| **Key Objections** | Preemptive answers       | "Is our data safe? Yes. Qumis is SOC 2 certified, and client data is private and never used for model training." |
| **Method**         | Channels                 | Email, huddles, recorded demos                                                                                   |
| **Timing**         | When                     | Week 1 of rollout                                                                                                |
| **Follow-up**      | How to reinforce         | Share FAQs (including security details), collect feedback, show early wins.                                      |

> **Tip:** Use real customer or internal examples — people relate to stories, not statistics.

---

## Step 2: Create Desire

### Purpose

Turn understanding into **motivation**.

### How to Build Desire

### Show 'what's in it for me'

Demonstrate benefits for each role to build personal motivation.

### Identify and empower champions early

Find early adopters who can model success and influence others.

### Recognize early adopters

Reward visible progress to encourage continued adoption.

### Invite experts to co-author Gold Prompts

Build ownership and recognize domain knowledge by having experts contribute to the prompt library (see Step 5).

### The Competitive Edge

Motivation is driven by the desire to win and the fear of being left behind. Frame the conversation around the tangible business advantages Qumis provides.

**Use Testimonial Power:**

> **Note:** "As Connor Love, National Director of Growth at IMA, noted: 'I thought, "No way it catches everything." But after using it on layered programs and seeing it find discrepancies I missed, I was sold.' Qumis acts as a second set of expert eyes, ensuring nothing gets missed."

**Frame Competitive Scenarios:**

| Scenario Question                                                                                                                                                   | Implications                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "A competitor using Qumis can analyze and compare 5 quotes in the time it takes us to do one. What does that mean for our next big renewal?"                        | Speed to market, winning more placements.     |
| "We can now provide an 'attorney-level' rationale for every claims decision, creating a defensible audit trail. How does this strengthen our client relationships?" | Increased trust, accuracy, and defensibility. |

### Updated Stakeholder Mapping Template

| Role                    | Influence Level | Likely Reaction           | Why This is Likely                                     | Engagement Plan                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Senior Broker**       | High            | **Supportive**            | Gains speed and leverage in client conversations.      | Include in pilot and quote-comparison demos.                                             |
| **Account Manager**     | Medium–High     | **Receptive**             | Contract Review reports simplify renewals and COIs.    | Prioritize demos; set "10 renewals in 30 days" quick-win goal.                           |
| **Claims Professional** | High            | **Cautious**              | Needs defensibility and clear audit trail.             | Highlight human oversight and documentation steps.                                       |
| **Service Team**        | Medium          | **Neutral → Supportive**  | Repetition-driven; needs embedded SOPs.                | Use short micro-trainings and office hours.                                              |
| **Niche Specialist**    | Medium–High     | **Resistant / Skeptical** | Deep domain pride; fears AI dilution or overpromising. | Co-create "gold prompts" for their use cases; feature them as authors in shared library. |

### Barrier Pulse & Playbook

Replace the static checklist with a **5-question pulse** survey (1–5 scale) tied to ADKAR.

| Element           | Question                                 | Low-Score Remedy                             |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Awareness**     | "I understand why we're adopting Qumis." | Re-share "Why Qumis" briefing & visuals      |
| **Desire**        | "I want to use Qumis in my work."        | Highlight time-saved stories or peer demos   |
| **Knowledge**     | "I know how to use Qumis."               | Assign micro-module or office hours          |
| **Ability**       | "I can perform my tasks using Qumis."    | Offer 1:1 coaching or co-working session     |
| **Reinforcement** | "We keep using Qumis regularly."         | Add recognition, refresh prompts, share data |

---

## Step 5: Reinforce the Change

### Purpose

Make adoption durable — the new normal, not a project.

### Reinforcement Tactics

- Track metrics monthly.
- Recognize visible usage.
- Share impact stories.
- Update SOPs and the prompt library quarterly.

---

### Adoption Metrics Dashboard

| Metric                  | Target  | Actual | Status       |
| :---------------------- | :------ | :----- | :----------- |
| **Active Users**        | 80%     | 65%    | 🔸 Improving |
| **Documents Processed** | 200     | 190    | ✅ On Track   |
| **Time Saved (%)**      | 50%     | 48%    | ✅ On Track   |
| **User Satisfaction**   | 4.0 / 5 | 4.3    | ✅ Achieved   |

---

### The Living Library of Expertise (Prompt Catalog)

**Purpose:** Standardize high-performing prompts, reduce "prompt fatigue," and create a central hub for shared knowledge that is curated and grown *by your team*.

**Recommended Patterns**

| Pattern                          | Use Case                | Example Prompt                                          | Expected Output    |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------- |
| **Coverage Comparison**          | Quote vs. quote         | "List coverage gaps between A and B policies."          | 3–5 bullet summary |
| **Exclusions Spotlight**         | Identify exclusions     | "Highlight exclusions affecting property or liability." | Bullet summary     |
| **Contract Obligations Extract** | For COI/Contract Review | "Summarize all insurance obligations in this contract." | Clause list        |
| **Claims Position Memo**         | Claims advocacy         | "Draft summary supporting coverage position."           | 1-page rationale   |

**Anti-Patterns**

- Asking multiple unrelated questions at once
- Uploading unstructured or missing documents
- Overloading context without clear focus

**Gold Prompts**

- Co-authored with niche experts.
- Reviewed monthly by department leads.
- **Credited by name in the library to build ownership and recognize expertise**.

| **Claim Advocacy**     | Support coverage positions        | Run Claims Analysis → Generate memo                | Uncertain policy language |

Each insert should list prompt examples, visual cues (✅ vs. ⚠️), and "when to ask for review."
