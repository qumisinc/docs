# Implementing AI

Source: get-started/foundations-for-success/implementing-ai

> **Info:** This guide provides a prescriptive, step-by-step roadmap for implementing **Qumis**, the attorney-trained Gen AI platform, within your insurance agency or brokerage. The strategy focuses on managing the major organizational shift by emphasizing **governance, role transformation, and sustained accuracy**.

---

The core principle is to treat Qumis as a **collaborative partner** and to **embed governance before scale**.

---

## Phase 1: Strategic Alignment & Governance (The Foundation)

This phase ensures all decisions are anchored to a clear business strategy and robust legal guardrails, utilizing **Qumis’s** core strengths: **Attorney-Trained AI** and **Enterprise Security**.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

Before engaging your team, you must internally confirm:

- **Project Mandate:** Senior leadership is committed to funding the project through the first year of metrics measurement.
- **Resource Allocation:** You have designated a **Qumis Governance Working Group (QGWG)** lead (likely the Project Manager) and secured a minimum of one part-time resource from **Compliance/Legal** to review policy in Step 1.4.

### Step 1: Craft the "Legal-Grade Speed" North Star and Core Value Statement

The goal is to define success and identify the key players who will drive the transformation.

| **1.1. Define the North Star**                        | **Facilitate a 1-hour "Vision Session"** with the **CEO**, Head of Sales/Production, and Head of Claims. Ask: "What major business metric are we trying to impact with attorney-trained **AI**?" Focus on measurable **outcomes**, not technology features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | *Deliverable:* Final **North Star Statement**. Example: "Achieve a 15% increase in premium growth and a 20% reduction in claims cycle time by embedding legal-grade analysis into every core workflow within 18 months." |
| **1.2. Identify High-Value Use Cases**                | **Conduct a 90-minute Brainstorming Session** with 3 top Brokers and 3 top Claims Professionals (Pros). Ask: "What are the 3 most complex documents or tasks where **legal-grade reasoning** would save you hours or secure a win?" and "Where does **manual analysis error** currently cost us the most time or money?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | *Deliverable:* Prioritized list of **3-5 Pilot Use Cases**. (e.g., Complex Directors and Officers (D\&O) Policy Comparison, Exclusions in a Catastrophic Claim).                                                          |
| **1.3. Conduct Stakeholder Mapping (Power/Interest)** | **Map all affected roles** on a 2x2 grid based on their *Power* (ability to approve/block) and *Interest* (how much their job changes). a. **High Power/High Interest:** *Manage Closely* (Executive Sponsor, **QGWG**). **Strategy:** Engage in weekly update meetings. b. **Low Power/High Interest:** *Keep Informed* (Account Managers, Claims **Pros**). **Strategy:** Engage in training and solicit feedback monthly. c. **High Power/Low Interest:** *Keep Satisfied* (Legal/Compliance). **Strategy:** Provide formal, quarterly security and governance reports. | *Deliverable:* **Power/Interest Grid** determining communication frequency and content for each group.                                                                                                                   |
| **1.4. Establish AI Governance Framework**            | The **QGWG** drafts the initial policy using **Qumis's** security guarantees as the foundation. a. **Mandate Private Document Vault:** Policy states all documents uploaded for analysis must use the **Qumis** Vault to ensure client data is protected. b. **Mandate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Policy defines clear **CHECKPOINTS** where a human review is required. *Example: Any output used for a final claim decision or policy coverage explanation to a client.*                                                                                                | *Deliverable:* **"Qumis Responsible Use Policy" (v1.0)**, formally approved by Legal/Compliance.                                                                                                                         |

## Phase 2: Implementation, Process Redesign, and Communication

This phase adapts your core business processes to leverage **Qumis's** capabilities, ensuring that every team member understands their new, elevated role.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

You must be able to:

- **Lead Change Impact Assessment (CIA) Workshops:** Understand the process of gathering the "As-Is" data through interviews and mapping to generate the "To-Be" vision.
- **Translate Features to Benefit:** Understand how **Qumis's** features (e.g., **Compare Documents**, **Claims Assessment**) directly address the bottlenecks in your four core workflows.

### Step 3: Redesign Core Workflows with Qumis

The goal is to eliminate manual document analysis and errors, shifting hours to client interaction and strategic judgment.

| Workflow         | "As-Is" Bottleneck/Error                                                                                                                                                    | Qumis Feature Integration ("To-Be" Process)                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Success Metric (Time/Quality)                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New Business** | Producer/Broker spends hours manually reviewing quotes and binders for non-obvious discrepancies before presenting to the client.                                           | **Broker/Producer** uploads competitive quotes to **Compare Documents**. **Qumis** instantly identifies true strategic leverage and non-standard exclusions. **Broker** uses this **Custom Report** to present authoritative advisory.        | **Time:** Reduction in **Quote-to-Bind Cycle Time**. **Quality:** 0 errors found in policy comparison audit.                                           |
| **Servicing**    | Account Manager (**AM**) searches for policy details across disparate systems to answer client coverage questions, often missing endorsements or amendments.                | **AM** uses **Chat with Documents** on the specific policy in the **Document Vault** to instantly verify coverage or find a specific exclusion clause. The **AM** can then use the **AI** to draft a compliant response.                      | **Time:** Reduction in **Average Handle Time (AHT)** for client coverage inquiries. **Quality:** Increase in **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**.   |
| **Claims**       | Claims **Pro** spends days manually interpreting complex policy language (especially Errors and Omissions (E\&O), **D\&O**) and writing the rationale for denial or approval. | Claims **Pro** uses **Claims Assessment** for legal-grade reasoning for coverage decisions. The pro utilizes the **Fill In Checklist (BETA)** to systematically verify all policy elements before generating a defensible **Custom Report**.  | **Time:** Reduction in **Claims Cycle Time** for complex cases. **Quality:** Reduction in claims file "Audit-Identified Policy Interpretation Errors." |
| **Renewal**      | Broker/**AM** misses cross-sell opportunities or fails to highlight new risks because they lack time for deep policy analysis.                                              | **AM** uses **Policy Analysis** to master the expiring policy’s key limits and exclusions in seconds, instantly identifying coverage gaps based on the client’s risk profile. **Broker** uses the insight to prepare a targeted upsell pitch. | **Business:** Increase in **Retention Rate** and **Cross-Sell/Upsell Conversion Rate**.                                                                |

### Step 4: Role-Specific Communication and Buy-In

Use a cascading communication plan, with managers delivering personalized messages to address specific fears and highlight professional growth.

| Role                     | Core Benefit from Qumis                                                  | Communication Strategy (Message to Deliver)                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Brokers**              | **Strategic Leverage** and **Faster Market Response**.                   | "Qumis makes you the **authoritative advisor** who moves faster than the competition. You get the **legal-grade insight** you need to **win more placements**."                                              |
| **Producers**            | **Faster Quote-to-Bind** cycle and **Policy Master** in seconds.         | "Your sales cycle shrinks. You can confidently discuss the complex coverage of a new placement and answer client questions instantly, increasing client trust."                                              |
| **Claims Professionals** | Accelerated, **Defensible Decisions**; **Elimination of Manual Errors**. | "Qumis acts like a **first-year associate, only faster and more accurate**, eliminating manual analysis errors and freeing you to focus on **judgment, negotiation, and client empathy**."                   |
| **Account Managers**     | **Time Recapture**; **Enhanced Customer Service**.                       | "Qumis is your new co-pilot for service. It frees up hours you spend digging for policy clauses, allowing you to handle more accounts and focus on **being the trusted advisor** and relationship builder."  |
| **Service Teams**        | **Expertise Democratization**; **Error Minimization**.                   | "You no longer need to wait for a senior underwriter to interpret complex language. Qumis gives you **attorney-level analysis** on demand, ensuring every client interaction is **accurate and compliant**." |

- **Adoption:** Track **Frequency of Use** (daily/weekly queries per user) and **Adoption Rate** (% of eligible staff using **Qumis** features in the new workflows).
- **Time/Efficiency:** Measure **AHT** for client servicing and **Time-to-Quote** for new business submissions.
- **Quality/Compliance:** Track the reduction in **Internal Audit Failures** related to policy or claim interpretation.

### Continuous Improvement Loop

- **Quarterly QGWG Review:** Review **KPIs** and team feedback. Identify the top 3 best-performing prompts/workflows and add them to the central **Prompt Library**.
- **Vendor Feedback:** Aggregate all reports of inaccurate/incomplete legal reasoning from the team and share with **Qumis** to leverage their **Bespoke** feature, where the "AI learns with use, becoming more personalized over time".

### Sustaining the Culture

Recognize and reward the **AI Accelerators** (your champions) who are successfully using the iterative dialogue to drive superior business results and mentor their peers.

# Identifying Use Cases

Source: get-started/foundations-for-success/identifying-use-cases

> **Info:** Adopting AI in insurance can feel overwhelming at first — especially if it's new to your team. This guide walks you through a **step-by-step process** for identifying where and how to embed Qumis into your daily workflows so you can get measurable results.

---

By the end of this article, you'll understand:

- How to map your team's workflows to Qumis features
- How to prioritize use cases that create fast, visible value
- How to define success metrics and track performance
- How to roll out AI responsibly across your organization

---

## Why It Matters

Teams that use Qumis successfully don't just "try AI" — they use it **intentionally**. They choose specific workflows, set clear expectations, and measure progress. This ensures the technology becomes an integral part of how they work rather than an experiment on the side.

The most successful users of Qumis include:

- **Producers and Brokers** who quickly understand what coverage their prospects have
- **Account Managers and Service Teams** who analyze and manage policy changes
- **Claims Professionals** who advocate for clients using clear, defensible policy interpretations

---

## Step-by-Step Framework for Identifying AI Use Cases

### Step 1: Map Your Workflow

Start by mapping out where your team spends most of its time. The goal is to find **document-heavy, repetitive tasks** that require judgment — the kind of work Qumis is built for.

**How to do it:**

### List your daily activities

For example, reviewing submissions, quoting, checking renewals, managing claims, or responding to client inquiries.

### Identify the document types

Note which documents you handle at each stage (quotes, policies, endorsements, contracts, COIs, complaints, etc.).

### Find pain points

Ask: "Where do we lose the most time or make the most errors?" Those are ideal starting points for AI.

Below is a guide showing how each workflow stage connects with a Qumis feature:

| Workflow Stage         | What It Means                                            | Qumis Feature                        | Value You'll See                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prospecting**        | Reviewing a prospect's current coverage                  | **Chat with Documents**              | Understand coverage faster and prepare smarter conversations with prospects          |
| **Quote Analysis**     | Comparing carrier quotes, binders, and submissions       | **Compare Documents**                | Identify key differences, exclusions, or advantages instantly                        |
| **Policy Checking**    | Reviewing policies for accuracy and completeness         | **Single Policy Analysis**           | Catch missing coverages and verify details before binding                            |
| **Account Management** | Managing ongoing client policies, endorsements, and COIs | **Contract Review & Coverage Table** | Ensure compliance, track requirements, and simplify renewals                         |
| **Claim Advocacy**     | Supporting clients through a claim                       | **Claims Analysis**                  | Analyze coverage for specific claim scenarios and provide defensible recommendations |

> **Tip:** Start with one stage (for example, prospecting or policy checking) and expand after your team gains confidence.

---

### Step 2: Prioritize by Impact and Effort

Once you've mapped your workflows, prioritize them using a simple two-by-two matrix:

|                 | **Easy to Implement**                                                               | **Harder to Implement**                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Impact** | Start here — these are your "quick wins" (e.g., quote comparisons, policy checking) | Plan next — large or complex processes (e.g., claim advocacy) |
| **Low Impact**  | Optional — automate only if time allows                                             | Avoid — minimal business benefit                              |

To evaluate impact, ask:

- Does this process happen frequently?
- Does it involve high-value clients or decisions?
- Would faster or more accurate results make a difference to customers or revenue?

---

### Step 3: Define What Success Looks Like

Before starting a pilot, choose **metrics** that help you measure improvement.

**How to set them:**

### Establish a baseline

Record how long a task takes now or how many documents are reviewed per week.

### Pick 2-3 key metrics

Such as:

- Time saved per document or per process
- Reduction in missed items or errors
- Faster turnaround on client deliverables
- Reduction in external legal or review costs

### Measure again after 30-45 days

You'll be able to see the real-world impact of Qumis.

**Example:**

> "Before Qumis, comparing three quotes took 3 hours. After introducing Qumis, it takes less than 30 minutes with improved accuracy."

---

### Step 4: Set Clear Roles and Governance

AI should enhance human expertise — not replace it.

**When rolling out Qumis:**

- **Producers and Brokers:** Use Qumis for initial document review and coverage insight before advising clients.
- **Account Managers and Service Teams:** Use Qumis to verify details, maintain consistency, and manage renewals.
- **Claims Professionals:** Use Qumis for coverage interpretation and defensible claim advocacy.

**To ensure long-term success:**

### Create review checkpoints

Have a team lead review outputs weekly during the first month.

### Use consistent prompts

Build a shared prompt library inside Qumis (e.g., "Summarize differences in property coverage between these quotes").

### Refine your approach

Use Qumis' *Custom Reports* and *Vault* features to document what works and share it across the team.

---

## Example Use Cases

| Role                    | Problem                                                          | How to Use Qumis                                                  | Metric for Success                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Producer**            | Hard to understand a new prospect's existing coverage            | Use *Chat with Documents* to review current policies instantly    | Reduce review time by 80%                |
| **Broker**              | Manual quote comparisons take hours                              | Use *Compare Documents* to highlight coverage differences         | Complete comparisons in under 30 minutes |
| **Account Manager**     | Policy changes and COIs are time-consuming to track              | Use *Contract Review* and *Coverage Table* to automate tracking   | 50% fewer manual compliance tasks        |
| **Claims Professional** | Difficult to identify applicable coverage language during claims | Use *Claims Analysis* for structured, defensible coverage reviews | Zero missed exclusions or provisions     |

---

# Change Management

Source: get-started/foundations-for-success/change-management

> **Info:** Implementing Qumis is not just about learning new technology — it's about transforming how your organization works.
>
> The insurance industry has a long history of established workflows and manual processes. Many professionals have developed expertise over decades, and they trust what's proven. However, the arrival of **Generative AI (GenAI)** is redefining what's possible. It can dramatically speed up policy analysis, improve accuracy, and reduce manual work — but only if your organization **manages the change thoughtfully**.
>
> This manual will teach you how to plan, guide, and sustain your Qumis implementation using the **ADKAR framework**, a proven model developed by Prosci to help people navigate change.

---

## What Is the ADKAR Framework?

**ADKAR** stands for:

1. **Awareness** – understanding why change is necessary
2. **Desire** – building motivation to support the change
3. **Knowledge** – learning how to make the change
4. **Ability** – putting new skills and behaviors into practice
5. **Reinforcement** – making the change stick

Each stage represents a milestone your people must achieve before the change can truly take hold. You can't skip steps; they build on one another.

---

## Step 1: Build Awareness

### What It Means

Awareness is helping your team understand **why** the organization is implementing Qumis and **what's at stake** if they don't adapt.

### Why It Matters

Insurance professionals are often cautious about new tools. Many have refined their workflows over decades and may feel that manual review or offshore outsourcing "works just fine." Without a clear "why," they'll see Qumis as extra work instead of an enabler.

### How to Build Awareness

### Craft a clear message from leadership

Communicate that Qumis isn't replacing expertise — it's **amplifying it**.

Example message:

> "We're implementing Qumis to reduce manual busywork so our teams can spend more time advising clients, not retyping policy details."

### Show the problem

Use data or examples:

- How much time is spent comparing policies manually?
- How often do errors occur due to manual entry or missed exclusions?

### Use relatable examples

Demonstrate real-life benefits:

- A broker who used Qumis to compare quotes in 10 minutes instead of 3 hours.
- A claims professional who used AI analysis to find coverage discrepancies others missed.

### Hold awareness sessions

- Host 30-minute "Why Qumis?" briefings for every department.
- Use visual demos showing before-and-after workflows.
- Encourage open discussion of fears or misconceptions.

> **Tip:** Awareness must come from leadership **and** direct managers. Employees trust messages most when they come from their immediate supervisors.

---

## Step 2: Create Desire

### What It Means

Desire is when people **want** to participate in and support the change.

### Why It Matters

People won't change their habits unless they see personal value. In insurance, that often means **saving time**, **reducing rework**, or **looking more professional** in front of clients.

### How to Build Desire

### Make it personal

Show how Qumis saves each role time and headaches.

Example: "You'll spend less time checking endorsements and more time winning renewals."

### Identify and engage champions

Find early adopters (e.g., a tech-savvy producer or service team member) who can model success. Let them share real examples of how Qumis made their job easier.

### Remove fears

Clarify that Qumis is **not** replacing jobs but improving quality and reducing burnout. Emphasize: "AI will handle the repetitive work; you'll handle the expert judgment."

### Incentivize adoption

Recognize or reward teams who complete their first successful Qumis workflow. Create friendly competitions (e.g., "Fastest Policy Checker of the Month").

---

## Step 3: Build Knowledge

### What It Means

Knowledge is giving your team the **skills and understanding** to use Qumis confidently.

### Why It Matters

Even motivated employees can get frustrated without clear, practical training — especially those who aren't used to AI tools or modern software platforms.

### How to Build Knowledge

### Create a structured training plan

Start with short sessions, not long lectures.

- **Session 1:** Logging in, uploading documents, and using Chat with Documents.
- **Session 2:** Comparing quotes and analyzing policies.
- **Session 3:** Using prompt libraries and custom reports.

### Use real examples

Train using your team's actual documents (quotes, policies, claims files). Familiar content helps learning stick.

### Record training sessions

So employees can rewatch when needed — ideal for those less confident with technology.

### Provide quick-reference guides

Offer one-page cheat sheets showing:

- How to upload and analyze a policy
- How to compare two documents
- How to use prompts effectively

### Encourage peer learning

- Pair less tech-savvy employees with "Qumis Champions."
- Create a Slack or Teams channel for Qumis questions and tips.

> **Tip:** Avoid information overload. People learn better through short, repeated exposure rather than one long session.

---

## Step 4: Develop Ability

### What It Means

Ability is when your team can **actually perform** the new behaviors — not just understand them.

### Why It Matters

Knowledge alone doesn't equal performance. You need to give people **practice, support, and feedback** until using Qumis becomes natural.

### How to Build Ability

### Start with low-risk tasks

Have teams analyze sample policies or claims before using Qumis on live client work.

### Set small goals

- Week 1: Upload and analyze one policy.
- Week 2: Compare two documents.
- Week 3: Use Qumis to generate one client-facing report.

### Provide on-the-job coaching

Managers or Qumis Champions should review outputs together. Discuss what went well and what can be improved.

### Encourage feedback

Ask users: "What confused you?" "What saved you the most time?" Capture feedback in a shared document or form.

### Celebrate early wins

Share stories where Qumis helped a client or saved hours of work. Public success stories build confidence across teams.

---

## Step 5: Reinforce the Change

### What It Means

Reinforcement ensures that using Qumis becomes a **habit**, not a one-time project.

### Why It Matters

Without reinforcement, old habits will return — especially in insurance, where "we've always done it this way" is a common refrain.

### How to Reinforce the Change

### Track usage and results

Use Qumis analytics (or internal tracking) to see how often features are used. Share metrics: "This month, Qumis saved our team 120 hours of manual work."

### Recognize consistent users

Highlight top adopters in company meetings or newsletters.

### Refresh training regularly

Offer quarterly "Qumis Refresher" sessions to introduce new features and address gaps.

### Document success stories

Turn real results into internal case studies (e.g., "How the Claims Team Reduced Review Time by 60%").

### Update procedures

Embed Qumis into standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklists. Example: "Step 2 – Upload policies into Qumis for automated review."

> **Tip:** Sustained reinforcement transforms AI from an "initiative" into part of your company culture.

## Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

| Challenge                                  | What's Happening                           | How to Address It                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **"We don't have time for this."**         | People are overloaded and fear extra work. | Start small — show how Qumis *saves* time on routine tasks.        |
| **"I don't trust AI."**                    | Fear of inaccuracy or job loss.            | Emphasize human oversight: AI supports expertise, not replaces it. |
| **"Our team's too set in our ways."**      | Long-standing habits are hard to break.    | Engage respected leaders early — their buy-in influences others.   |
| **"This isn't how we've always done it."** | Cultural resistance to innovation.         | Reinforce results — once people see value, attitudes shift.        |

---

## Step 0: Assess Readiness & Define Success

Before communicating the change, leadership must align on the goals and assess the organization's readiness. A clear starting point and destination are critical for success.

### Leadership Alignment Checklist

Use these questions to confirm strategic alignment before kickoff:

- Have we clearly identified the top 2-3 business problems Qumis will solve (e.g., proposal speed, error reduction, renewal efficiency)?
- Have we defined the 3-5 key metrics that will define a successful pilot?
- Is the executive sponsor prepared to dedicate at least 2 hours per month to champion this initiative?
- Have we used the **Value Tracker Pack** (see Step 4) to capture our *current* "before" metrics?

### The "Before" State Snapshot

Use the **Value Tracker Pack** to baseline your current metrics *before* the project begins. This transforms the tracker from a historical record into a proactive business case tool, clearly demonstrating ROI later.

---

## Step 1: Build Awareness

### Purpose

Help everyone understand **why** Qumis is being introduced and what challenges it solves.

### How to Build Awareness

### Deliver a leadership message

Link Qumis to real pain points with a clear message from leadership.

### Show before-and-after visuals

Demonstrate **Expert Review vs. Expert + Qumis Review** to illustrate the value.

### Address security questions head-on

Communicate that Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified** and that **client data is always private and never used for AI training**.

### Host 'Why Qumis?' sessions

Invite discussion and feedback to build understanding and buy-in.

### Communication Template

| Item               | Description              | Example                                                                                                          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**           | What to communicate      | "Qumis cuts manual policy reviews by 60%, freeing our best minds for client strategy."                           |
| **Audience**       | Who needs to hear it     | Producers, brokers, account managers, claims teams                                                               |
| **Messenger**      | Who delivers the message | Executive sponsor and direct managers                                                                            |
| **Key Objections** | Preemptive answers       | "Is our data safe? Yes. Qumis is SOC 2 certified, and client data is private and never used for model training." |
| **Method**         | Channels                 | Email, huddles, recorded demos                                                                                   |
| **Timing**         | When                     | Week 1 of rollout                                                                                                |
| **Follow-up**      | How to reinforce         | Share FAQs (including security details), collect feedback, show early wins.                                      |

> **Tip:** Use real customer or internal examples — people relate to stories, not statistics.

---

## Step 2: Create Desire

### Purpose

Turn understanding into **motivation**.

### How to Build Desire

### Show 'what's in it for me'

Demonstrate benefits for each role to build personal motivation.

### Identify and empower champions early

Find early adopters who can model success and influence others.

### Recognize early adopters

Reward visible progress to encourage continued adoption.

### Invite experts to co-author Gold Prompts

Build ownership and recognize domain knowledge by having experts contribute to the prompt library (see Step 5).

### The Competitive Edge

Motivation is driven by the desire to win and the fear of being left behind. Frame the conversation around the tangible business advantages Qumis provides.

**Use Testimonial Power:**

> **Note:** "As Connor Love, National Director of Growth at IMA, noted: 'I thought, "No way it catches everything." But after using it on layered programs and seeing it find discrepancies I missed, I was sold.' Qumis acts as a second set of expert eyes, ensuring nothing gets missed."

**Frame Competitive Scenarios:**

| Scenario Question                                                                                                                                                   | Implications                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "A competitor using Qumis can analyze and compare 5 quotes in the time it takes us to do one. What does that mean for our next big renewal?"                        | Speed to market, winning more placements.     |
| "We can now provide an 'attorney-level' rationale for every claims decision, creating a defensible audit trail. How does this strengthen our client relationships?" | Increased trust, accuracy, and defensibility. |

# Single Sign On

Source: get-started/setup-and-access/single-sign-on

> **Info:** This guide will help your IT team configure Single Sign-On (SSO) with Qumis. SSO allows your employees to access Qumis using your organization's existing identity provider credentials, streamlining access management and enhancing security.

---

Qumis supports both **SAML 2.0** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** protocols, making it compatible with all major enterprise identity providers including:

- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Okta
- Google Workspace
- OneLogin
- Auth0
- Ping Identity
- And other SAML 2.0 or OIDC-compliant providers

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the SSO setup process, ensure you have:

- **Administrative access** to your organization's identity provider (IdP)
- **Contact with your Qumis representative** to coordinate the setup
- **Organization details** ready (domain(s) to be used for SSO)
- **User provisioning plan** (which users or groups should have access to Qumis)

## Setup Timeline

Typical SSO implementation takes 1-3 business days, depending on your organization's internal processes and IdP configuration complexity.

---

## Information Required from Your Organization

Your Qumis Customer Success team will request the following information to configure SSO on our end:

### 1. Organization Details

- **Email Domain(s)**: Domain(s) that will be used for SSO authentication (e.g., yourcompany.com)
- **Primary Contact**: Name and email of the technical contact for SSO setup

### 2. Identity Provider Information

#### For SAML 2.0 Connections

- **IdP Entity ID / Issuer URL**: Unique identifier for your identity provider
- **SSO URL / Sign-On URL**: The endpoint where authentication requests will be sent
- **X.509 Certificate**: Public certificate from your IdP for validating SAML assertions
- **Attribute Mapping** (if different from defaults):
  - Email address attribute
  - First name attribute
  - Last name attribute

#### For OIDC Connections

- **Client ID**: OAuth client identifier from your IdP
- **Client Secret**: OAuth client secret (will be stored securely)
- **Authorization Endpoint**: URL for the OAuth authorization request
- **Token Endpoint**: URL for exchanging authorization codes for tokens
- **JWKS URI**: JSON Web Key Set endpoint for validating tokens
- **Issuer**: The identifier of your OIDC provider

---

## Configuration Steps

### Contact Qumis Customer Success

Reach out to your Qumis Customer Success Manager or email [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai) to initiate the SSO setup process. We'll schedule a brief kickoff call to review requirements and timeline.

### Configure Qumis Application in Your IdP

Your IT team will need to add Qumis as an application in your identity provider. Qumis will provide you with:

- **Service Provider (SP) Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Qumis
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Where SAML assertions or OIDC tokens should be sent
- **Callback/Redirect URI**: For OIDC flows

*Follow your IdP's documentation to create a new SSO application with these values.*

### Provide Configuration Details to Qumis

Once you've configured Qumis in your IdP, send the required information (listed in the "Information Required" section above) to your Qumis representative securely.

**For SAML:** You can provide either:

- IdP metadata XML file, OR
- Individual configuration values (Entity ID, SSO URL, Certificate)

**For OIDC:** Provide:

- Client ID and Client Secret
- Well-known configuration URL (if available), OR
- Individual endpoint URLs

### Qumis Configuration

The Qumis team will configure the SSO connection on our platform using the information you provided. This typically takes 1-2 business days.

### Testing

Once Qumis confirms the configuration is complete:

1. **Initial Test**: A designated test user should attempt to log in to Qumis using SSO
2. **Verify User Details**: Confirm that user information (name, email) is populated correctly
3. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - Existing user login
   - Access to appropriate resources and permissions

### Production Rollout

After successful testing:

1. Enable SSO for additional user groups as planned
2. Communicate the new login process to your users
3. Update any internal documentation

---

## User Login Experience

Once SSO is configured, your users will access Qumis as follows:

### Navigate to Qumis

Go to your organization's Qumis login page: `https://app.qumis.ai`

### Enter company email

Users enter their company email address.

### Click 'Continue with SSO'

Select the SSO option to proceed with authentication.

### Authenticate with your IdP

Users are redirected to your organization's identity provider to log in.

### Automatic sign-in

After authenticating with your IdP, users are automatically signed into Qumis.

---

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- All SSO communications are encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols
- Your IdP credentials are never stored by Qumis
- Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified** with enterprise-grade security
- Your organization's data remains private and is never used for AI training

### Authentication Flow

- SSO connections are scoped to your specific organization
- Each authentication request is validated against your IdP in real-time
- Session management follows security best practices with configurable timeout periods

---

## Multi-Organization Access (Advanced)

If your company has multiple Qumis organization instances (common with M\&A activity, international subsidiaries, or separate departments), you can configure External SSO Connections to allow users to authenticate across organizations with a single SSO setup.

Contact your Qumis Customer Success Manager if this applies to your use case.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Users receive 'SSO Configuration Not Found' error

- Verify that the user's email domain matches the domain configured for SSO
- Confirm the SSO connection is active in Qumis
- Check that users are assigned to the Qumis application in your IdP

### SAML assertion errors

- Verify the X.509 certificate is current and hasn't expired
- Confirm the ACS URL is correctly configured in your IdP
- Check that attribute mappings match expected values

### OIDC authentication failures

- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Confirm redirect URI exactly matches the value in your IdP
- Check that required scopes (openid, email, profile) are granted

### Users created but missing information

- Review attribute/claim mappings in your IdP configuration
- Verify that user profiles in your IdP contain the required fields

### Support

For assistance with SSO configuration or troubleshooting:

- **Email**: [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai)

When contacting support, please include:

- Your organization name
- Description of the issue
- Screenshots of any error messages
- Approximate time the issue occurred

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we enforce SSO as the only login method?

Yes. Once SSO is configured and tested, Qumis will automatically disable alternative authentication methods for your organization.

### What happens if our IdP experiences downtime?

Users will be unable to log in via SSO during IdP downtime. Contact Qumis support if you need temporary alternative access enabled.

### Can we configure multiple IdP connections?

Organizations typically use a single IdP connection. Contact your Customer Success Manager if you have a specific use case requiring multiple connections.

### How do we offboard users?

Remove user access in your IdP by unassigning them from the Qumis application. They will be unable to authenticate on their next login attempt.

### Does SSO support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Yes. MFA enforcement is managed through your identity provider. When MFA is required by your IdP, users will complete MFA as part of the SSO flow.

### Can we customize the login page?

Qumis provides a standard enterprise login experience. For custom branding requirements, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

# Chats

Source: features/chats

> **Info:** Use Qumis' **Chats** to ask natural-language questions about your insurance documents and get attorney-grade answers with citations. This guide walks you through the whole flow—from opening Chats to asking questions, saving work, and troubleshooting.

---

## What you can do with Chats (at a glance)

- Ask plain-English questions about policies, quotes, binders, applications, contracts, and claims docs.
- Get structured answers with legal-grade reasoning and references.
- Keep documents private; data in Qumis is **not used to train** the AI and is stored in a private encrypted vault.

---

## Before you start

- Have one or more documents ready (PDF, Word, Excel, images: JPG/PNG/TIFF).
- If your files are already in **Vault**, you can pull them directly into a chat later.

---

## 1) Open the Chats workspace

### Navigate to Chats

From the left sidebar, click **Chats**.

On **Home**, you'll also see other tools like *Chat with Documents*, *Compare Documents*, *Claims*, *Policy Analysis*, and *Contracts* (all accessible from the same sidebar later).

![Qumis Home screen showing navigation and feature cards](/images/screenshots/home-dashboard.png)

---

## 2) Start a new chat

### Create a new chat

In **Chats**, click **New Chat** at the top of the list.

### Choose how to add files

You'll see a welcome message and two ways to add files:

- **Search and Add Documents From Vault** (pull existing files), or
- **Drop files here** (drag & drop from your computer).

![New Chat empty view with upload options](/images/screenshots/chats-policy-analysis.png)

> **Tip:** You can add more than one file to the same chat to ask cross-document questions (e.g., compare a quote to a policy).

---

## 3) Add documents

### Option A — Upload from your computer

1. Drag a file into the **Drop files here** box, or click it to select a file.

### Option B — Pull from Vault

1. Click in the **Search and Add Documents From Vault** bar.
2. Search by file name and select the document(s) you want.

> **Note:** **Security note:** Documents live in your private, encrypted **Vault**; they remain protected and reusable across workflows.

---

## 4) Wait for automatic OCR & ingestion

- After you add files, Qumis runs OCR and parsing automatically.
- You'll see a **Processing OCR** progress window with a checkmark when each file finishes.

![Processing OCR window showing document extraction progress](/images/screenshots/chats-ocr-processing.png)

If you close the window accidentally, don't worry—processing continues in the background and you can start typing your question once the file shows as loaded.

---

## 5) Get oriented to the chat screen

Once at least one document is loaded, the chat view shows:

- **Documents** menu (top-right of the chat pane) with a badge count (e.g., “1”).
- **Hide Citations** toggle (top-right). Turn this off to **see** reference citations in responses.
- **Suggested actions** (buttons) to help you get started, such as:
  - *Analyze policy coverage*
  - *Identify key exclusions*
  - *Compare coverage to industry standards*
  - *Check for specific endorsements*

![Chats interface showing loaded document and suggested actions](/images/screenshots/chats-overview.png)

- **Chat list** (left sidebar) with your recent and older chats. Click any item to reopen it. You'll also see pagination at the bottom of the list.

### Submit and review the answer

Press **Ask ↵**.

Qumis reads the uploaded document(s) and replies with an answer. If citations are visible, click them to see the exact source passages extracted from your files.

> **Info:** **What kinds of analyses can I ask for?** Coverage checks, exclusions, policy requirements, legal compliance, claims assessments, and more.

---

## 7) Refine, dig deeper, and compare

- **Follow-ups:** Ask clarifying questions (“Show me where that exclusion is”) or ask Qumis to *quote the wording* that supports the answer.
- **Multiple docs:** Add additional files via the **Documents** menu and ask cross-document questions (e.g., *“Compare this quote to the binder and list material differences.”*).
- **Explain it simply:** Ask for plain-language summaries to share with clients or teammates.
- **Turn citations on:** If the **Hide Citations** toggle is on, click it to turn citations **off** (so references show).

---

## 8) Save and find your work later

- Every conversation is saved automatically in the **Chats** list on the left with a timestamp.
- Click any past chat to reopen it and continue where you left off.

---

## Best practices (for non-technical users)

- **Start broad, then narrow.** Begin with a big question (“Summarize key coverages and limits”), then follow with specifics (“List all sublimits and deductibles with page cites”).
- **Ask for the ‘why’.** If you’re unfamiliar with an answer, ask Qumis to *explain* it or *show the exact policy wording.*
- **Use Vault for organization.** Keep your latest policy, quote, binder, and endorsements in Vault so you can pull them into a chat quickly.
- **Respect privacy standards.** Qumis is SOC 2 Type I and does **not** train on your data. You can safely analyze client materials.

---

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my document after uploading

Wait for the **Processing OCR** window to finish. If it stalls, remove the file and re-add it. Check that the file type is supported (PDF, Word, Excel, JPG/PNG/TIFF).

### Responses don't show citations

Toggle **Hide Citations** off (top-right).

### My question seems too broad

Use a suggested action (buttons under the chat box) to guide the analysis, then ask follow-ups.

### I need to find an older conversation

Scroll the chat list on the left, or use pagination at the bottom to move between pages.

---

## Example prompts you can copy

```text Coverage Summary

```

```text Requirements Extraction
Extract all policy requirements and obligations I need to track.
```

```text Plain Language Explanation
Explain the deductible and sublimit structure like I'm new to insurance.
```

## Where Chats fits in the Qumis platform

Chats sits alongside **Compare Documents**, **Claims**, **Policy Analysis**, and **Contracts** to cover end-to-end insurance analysis. Many users start in Chats, then move to comparisons or report generation for client-facing deliverables.

# Document Vault

Source: features/document-vault

> **Info:** The **Vault** is your secure digital filing cabinet for all insurance-related documents. Upload PDFs, Word files, Excel sheets, or images and make them instantly accessible for Chats, Comparisons, Claims, and Custom Reports.

---

## What is the Vault?

- A centralized repository for all your uploaded files.
- Files stored here can be used across all Qumis tools — Chats, Comparisons, Claims, and Custom Reports.
- **My Vault** is private to you and only you can see your files.
- **Shared Vault** is visible to everyone in your company, allowing teams to collaborate on shared insurance policies and supporting documents.

---

## Before you start

> **Info:** **Prerequisites:**
>
> - Have documents ready to upload (PDF, Word, Excel, images: JPG/PNG/TIFF).
> - Know whether documents are for your personal use (My Vault) or team collaboration (Shared Vault).

---

## 1) Open the Vault

### Access the Vault

From the left sidebar, click **Vault**.

### Choose your vault type

You'll see two tabs:

- **My Vault** — your private document space.
- **Shared Vault** — shared company-wide document storage.

![Qumis Vault main interface showing My Vault and Shared Vault tabs](/images/screenshots/prompts-dashboard.png)

---

## 2) Upload a document

You have two ways to add documents to your Vault:

### Method 1 — Upload directly from your computer

#### Option A — Drag and drop

1. Simply drag your file(s) into the **Drop files here** box at the top of the Vault page.
2. Once the upload completes, a green confirmation will appear next to your file name.

#### Option B — Use the file picker

1. Click inside the **Drop files here** box.
2. This opens your computer's file browser (Finder or File Explorer).
3. Select one or more documents to upload, then click **Open**.

Supported file types: **PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, TIFF**.

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> You can upload multiple files at once.

![File picker dialog showing file selection for upload](/images/screenshots/vault-my-documents.png)

### Method 2 — Email documents directly to Qumis

You can send documents directly to your Vault without logging into Qumis by emailing them to [**clerk@qumis.ai**](mailto:clerk@qumis.ai).

### Attach documents to email

Attach one or more documents to an email (supported formats: PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, TIFF).

### Send to Qumis

Send the email to [**clerk@qumis.ai**](mailto:clerk@qumis.ai).

### Verify upload

Your documents will automatically appear in your **My Vault** within a few minutes.

This is a convenient way to capture quotes, binders, endorsements, and other documents as you receive them from underwriters, brokers, and other contacts—no need to remember to upload them later from storage.

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Use descriptive email subject lines to help organize your documents (e.g., "ABC Corp Quote Jan 2025"). The subject line will help you identify the document in your Vault.

---

## 3) Confirm successful upload

Once uploaded, your document appears in **My Vault** with a green highlight and checkmark. Each file shows:

- **Name** — file title (editable with the pencil icon).
- **Type** — document category such as *Reference* or *Attachment*.
- **Created At** — the upload date.
- **Actions** — options to delete or manage the file.

![Vault showing successfully uploaded file with green highlight and checkmark](/images/screenshots/vault-shared-documents.png)

### Set document type (optional but recommended)

After uploading, click the **Select Document Type** dropdown to categorize your file. This makes it easier to search and organize files later.

---

## 4) Manage and organize files

As your Vault grows, use these tools to stay organized:

- **Search bar** — find documents by name. Type a document name to locate it instantly.
- **Type filter** — filter by *Reference*, *Attachment*, or *All Types* to view specific categories.
- **Sorting** — click **Name** or **Created At** column headers to reorder your files.
- **Pagination** — navigate between pages of files using the arrows at the bottom if you have many documents.

![Vault view showing multiple documents with search, filters, and pagination controls](/images/screenshots/vault-shared-documents.png)

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Name files descriptively so they're easy to find later, e.g., "Acme Corp Property Policy 2025.pdf" instead of "policy.pdf".

---

## 5) Using Shared Vault for team collaboration

The **Shared Vault** lets your entire team work with the same documents.

- Documents in **Shared Vault** are visible to **everyone in your company** (but not outside your organization).
- Perfect for teams that collaborate on policy reviews, client files, binders, or endorsement documents.
- Everyone can access and analyze the same files in Chats, Comparisons, and other tools.

![Shared Vault tab showing shared company documents](/images/screenshots/prompts-dashboard.png)

### Best practices for Shared Vault

- **Upload finalized documents** — use Shared Vault for completed policies and shared resources, not drafts.
- **Keep current versions** — when a policy renews or changes, upload the new version so everyone has the latest information.
- **Use clear naming conventions** — help your team find files quickly with descriptive names like "ClientName\_Policy\_Year" so everyone knows what they're looking at.
- **Communicate changes** — if you update or replace a shared document, let your team know so they use the correct version.

---

## 6) Edit or delete files

### Rename a document

### Click the pencil icon

Click the **pencil icon** next to the file name in the **Name** column.

### Enter new name

Type a new name and confirm.

### Delete a document

### Click the trash icon

Click the **trash icon** in the **Actions** column.

### Confirm deletion

Confirm the deletion.

> **Note:**&#x20;
>
> If you delete from&#x20;
>
> **My Vault**
>
> , only you lose access. If you delete from&#x20;
>
> **Shared Vault**
>
> , everyone in your organization loses access to it—use caution when deleting shared documents. Consider messaging your team before removing shared files.

---

## 7) Use Vault files across Qumis tools

Once documents are in Vault, you can access them from anywhere in Qumis without re-uploading:

- **Chats** — Click "Search and Add Documents From Vault" to pull documents directly into your chat and ask questions about them.
- **Comparisons** — Compare multiple documents stored in Vault side-by-side.
- **Claims** — Evaluate coverages from stored claims documents.
- **Custom Reports** — Generate professional summaries from Vault documents.

This saves time and ensures every tool works with the same trusted document source.

---

## Example workflow

### Upload to My Vault

Upload a new client policy to **My Vault** with a descriptive name (e.g., "ABC Manufacturing General Liability 2025").

### Analyze in Chat

Create a new chat, search for the document in Vault, and pull it in.

### Ask questions

Ask questions about the policy to get analysis and insights.

### Share with your team

Upload the document to **Shared Vault** so colleagues can access and analyze it too.

### Reuse documents

Use the document in future chats, comparisons, and reports without re-uploading—just search for it in Vault.

---

## Best practices

- **Start with key documents** — upload your most-used policies, quotes, and templates so you can build your collection over time.
- **Use descriptive names** — future you and your teammates will appreciate clear file names.
- **Organize by client or type** — consider naming conventions that group related documents together logically.
- **Leverage Shared Vault for team efficiency** — if you work in a team, use Shared Vault for policies your whole team needs so nobody has to hunt for files.
- **Clean up old versions** — periodically review your vault and delete outdated documents to keep things tidy.
- **Upload once, use everywhere** — pull documents into Chats and other tools from Vault instead of re-uploading the same file multiple times.

---

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my file after uploading

Wait a few seconds for the upload to finish. Try refreshing the page. Confirm the file is in a supported format (PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, or TIFF).

### I uploaded to the wrong vault (My Vault vs. Shared Vault)

You can re-upload the document to the correct vault. Delete the original from the wrong location if needed.

### Can others outside my company see Shared Vault files?

No. Shared Vault is organization-only and visible only to people in your company.

### I want to delete a document but I'm not sure if anyone else is using it

If it's in Shared Vault, consider messaging your team before deleting to avoid disrupting their work. If it's in My Vault, only you have access, so you can delete freely.

### I accidentally deleted a file

Files are permanently deleted, but you can re-upload a copy if you have the original on your computer.

---

## Where Document Vault fits in the Qumis platform

Document Vault is the centralized hub for all your insurance documents. Use it alongside **Chats**, **Comparisons**, **Claims**, and **Custom Reports** to power your entire insurance analysis workflow. Keep your documents in Vault, then pull them into the tools you need for analysis, comparison, and reporting.

---

### Why use Document Vault?

Qumis Vault provides centralized document management integrated directly with Qumis AI workflows—enabling effortless collaboration, fast document retrieval, and consistent access to your key insurance files across the entire platform.

# Prompt Library

Source: features/prompt-library

> **Info:** The **Prompt Library** helps you create, save, and reuse structured AI instructions—called *prompts*—for faster and more consistent insurance document analysis. Whether you're drafting a detailed policy analysis or refining a question for Chat, the Prompt Library keeps your best prompts at your fingertips.

---

## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is a reusable instruction you give to Qumis AI. For example:

> **Note:** "Review this policy for exclusions related to subcontractor work and summarize findings for a contractor client."

Unlike general AI tools, Qumis is purpose-built for insurance professionals. The insurance expertise and reasoning are already built in—you don't need to tell Qumis to "think like an expert" or give it a persona. Simply focus on what you want analyzed and how you want the output formatted.

Prompts are great for:

- Standardizing analysis across your team.
- Quickly generating complex outputs (like coverage tables or policy comparisons).
- Saving your coverage checklists and frequently used review workflows.
- Reducing repetitive typing in Chats or Reports.

Once created, you can reuse a saved prompt anywhere in Qumis—in **Chats** or **Reports**—by clicking the book icon and selecting it.

---

## Before you start

- Have a sense of the types of questions or analyses you perform frequently.
- Know whether you want to create a prompt from scratch or refine an existing question using Qumis's prompt enhancement tool.

---

## 1) Access the Prompt Library

### Click Prompts from the left sidebar

Navigate to the **Prompts** section from the left sidebar.

### View the Prompt Library interface

You'll see a searchable list of saved prompts on the left and a detail view on the right.

### Search for prompts

Use the **Search prompts...** bar to quickly find prompts by name or keyword.

---

## 2) Browse existing prompts

The Prompt Library includes built-in and saved prompts. Each prompt shows:

- A descriptive title (e.g., "Workers Comp Review," "Cyber Coverage Analysis")
- A brief description of what the prompt does
- Associated documents or context

Click any prompt to view its full content and use it.

---

## 3) Create a new prompt

### Click + Create New button

Click the **+ Create New** button in the upper-right corner.

### Fill in the prompt form

A form appears with two fields:

- **Prompt Name** — give your prompt a clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Extract All Coverage Limits" or "Commercial General Liability Checklist")
- **Enter prompt content...** — type your instruction or question

### Write your prompt in plain English

Qumis will understand and execute it when used later. Focus on:

- What task you want Qumis to perform
- What information to extract or analyze
- How you want the output formatted
- Any specific focus areas

Since Qumis is built specifically for insurance professionals, the expertise is already built in—just describe what you need analyzed and how you want it presented.

```text Analysis Prompt
Review this policy for exclusions related to subcontractor work. Summarize findings in a client-friendly format highlighting risks.
```

```text Coverage Checklist Prompt
Using this Workers Compensation policy, verify coverage for the following: Employee classifications, state coverage, occupational disease coverage, employer's liability limits, and voluntary compensation. Flag any missing or inadequate coverages.
```

---

## 4) Refine your prompt with the magic wand

On the right side of the prompt editor, you'll see a **magic wand icon**. Clicking it activates Qumis's AI-powered refinement tool, which automatically improves your prompt for clarity, focus, and impact.

The magic wand works best when your initial idea is broad—let Qumis rewrite it into a professional-grade prompt by:

- Adding specific instructions
- Clarifying the desired output format
- Suggesting relevant data fields to extract
- Improving structure and specificity

You'll also find this magic wand in **Chats** and **Report creation** to polish ad-hoc questions into stronger prompts.

> **Tip:** The wand works best with broad starting questions. The more general your initial prompt, the more value the enhancement will add.

---

## 5) Save your prompt

### Click Save Prompt

Once you're happy with the text, click **Save Prompt** at the bottom right.

### Access your saved prompt

Your new prompt now appears in the left panel list and can be reused at any time.

### Use across modules

Your prompt is stored securely in your Qumis account and is accessible in other modules.

---

## 6) View and manage saved prompts

### Select a prompt from the list

Click the prompt name in the left list.

### View the prompt content

Its content appears in the editor pane on the right.

### Edit or delete the prompt

You can:

- Edit the name or text directly in the fields
- Click the **edit icon** (pencil) to modify the prompt
- Click the **delete icon** (trash) to remove it permanently

---

## 7) Example of a detailed prompt

Here's what a professional insurance prompt might look like:

**Example prompt content:**

> **Note:** "Analyze the provided Builders Risk insurance policy to assess its adequacy for a general contractor performing construction services in the Southeastern US. Include:
>
> - Named Insureds list
> - Coverage Territory with geographical focus
> - Coverage Limits per building and per job site for each coverage type
> - Additional Coverages available
> - Policy Requirements and Conditions
> - Key Exclusions and their impact on operations"

---

Edit the text directly or click the **magic wand icon** to refine it further.

### Save the changes

Click **Save Prompt** again to overwrite the old version.

> **Tip:** You can iterate on prompts over time, improving them based on results you get from using them.

---

## Best practices for creating prompts

- **Save your coverage checklists.** Convert the coverage verification checklists you use repeatedly into Prompt Library items. This ensures consistent coverage audits across your team and clients.
- **Document frequently asked questions.** Save common questions or analyses you perform (e.g., "Check for independent contractor coverage," "Summarize all exclusions").
- **Start broad, then refine.** Write your idea plainly, then use the magic wand to make it stronger.
- **Be descriptive with names.** Use clear, specific names like "WC Coverage Verification Checklist" or "Cyber Exclusions Audit" for easy searching.
- **Write detailed instructions.** The more specific your prompt, the better Qumis's analysis. Include context about what you're evaluating and why.
- **Specify output format.** Tell Qumis how you want results—table, list, narrative summary, checklist, etc.
- **Include focus areas.** Mention what's most important (e.g., "Flag gaps in contractor coverage" or "Highlight non-standard terms").
- **Group prompts by function.** Organize by use case: "Coverage Checklists," "Claims Analysis," "Quote Comparison," "Client Reports," etc.
- **Test before sharing.** Use a prompt on a sample document first to make sure it works as intended.
- **Reuse across tools.** A single prompt can power Chats, Reports, and document analyses.
- **Iterate over time.** Improve prompts based on results. Use the magic wand to refine prompts that aren't working as expected.

---

## Example prompts to get you started

### Coverage Checklists

```text WC Coverage Verification
Verify this Workers Comp policy includes employee classifications, state coverage, occupational disease coverage, employer's liability limits, and voluntary compensation. Flag any gaps.
```

```text General Liability Audit
Review this GL policy and confirm: named insureds match our records, coverage territory is correct, coverage limits are adequate for the business, and no unusual exclusions apply.
```

```text Cyber Policy Coverage Check
Confirm this cyber policy covers: first-party data breach response, third-party liability, regulatory fines, business interruption, and ransomware. Note any exclusions or sublimits.
```

### For Brokers

```text Quote Comparison
Compare this quote to the incumbent policy and identify 5 key differences that represent either better coverage or cost savings. Format for client presentation.
```

```text Premium Extraction
Extract all premium, taxes, and fees in a table format for proposal presentation. Include comparisons to current policy if available.
```

### For Claims Professionals

```text Coverage Determination
Analyze this claim scenario against the policy and determine if coverage applies. Cite specific policy language supporting your conclusion.
```

```text Exclusions Analysis
Identify all policy conditions, exclusions, and endorsements relevant to this type of claim. Flag any that may limit coverage.
```

### For Risk Professionals

```text Limits Summary
Summarize all coverage limits, sublimits, and deductibles by line of business in an easy-to-read table format.
```

```text Requirements Extraction
Extract all policy requirements and obligations the insured must follow to maintain coverage. Highlight those most critical for ongoing compliance.
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my saved prompt in Chats or Reports

Make sure it was saved successfully in the Prompts Library. Refresh the page and look for it under the book icon menu.

### The magic wand didn't change my prompt

Try giving it a broader or more general starting point for better results.

### I can't save a prompt

Check that both the name and text fields are filled in.

### I want to modify a prompt but don't want to lose the original

Create a new version with a slightly different name (e.g., "Extract Limits" vs. "Extract Limits - Client Facing"). Both versions will be available.

### My prompt returns different results on different policies

This is normal—Qumis adapts responses based on document content. Refine your prompt to be more specific if you need more consistent output. Use the magic wand to add structure and clarity.

---

## Where Prompt Library fits in the Qumis platform

The **Prompt Library** integrates with **Chats** and **Reports** to let you standardize your analysis workflows. Save time and improve consistency by reusing well-crafted prompts across your team's insurance analysis work.

# Claims Analysis

Source: reports/claims

> **Info:** The **Claim Analysis Report** helps brokers, account managers, and claims professionals understand whether an insured's policy (or multiple policies) may respond to a particular claim. By analyzing both the policy language and the claim's fact pattern, Qumis identifies key coverage triggers, exclusions, and conditions—and provides a clear opinion on how the policy applies.

---

## What this report does

When handling a claim, brokers and claims professionals often need to evaluate whether coverage applies and why. Qumis automates this analysis by:

- Reading and interpreting all relevant policy documents
- Reviewing the claim facts (e.g., FNOL, demand letter, lawsuit, or denial letter)
- Identifying relevant clauses, exclusions, and coverage triggers
- Explaining whether and why the claim should or shouldn't be covered
- Providing specific reasoning backed by policy language

You can also chat directly with the report to explore deeper coverage questions. Each chat is saved, and multiple threads can be maintained per report—making it especially valuable for complex claims and rebutting claim denials.

---

## Before you start

> **Note:** **Prerequisites:**
>
> - Have the insured's policy or policies ready.
> - Have claim documentation ready (FNOL, demand letter, lawsuit, ROR, claim denial letter, or other fact pattern).
> - Know the general nature of the claim you're analyzing.
> - Have 5-10 minutes to set up and generate the report.

---

## 1) Access the Claim Analysis tool

### Navigate to Claims

From the sidebar, click **Claims**. You'll see a list of your existing claim reports and the option to start a new one.

### Start a new report

Select **Generate Coverage Report** to begin.

Each completed analysis is saved and can be revisited at any time.

## 2) Enter the claim number

Start by giving your claim a reference number or name (e.g., "2025-004 Slip & Fall").

A five-step workflow guides you through the analysis:

- **Step 1: Claim Number**
- **Step 2: Policy Documents**
- **Step 3: Fact Patterns**
- **Step 4: Additional Information**
- **Step 5: Generate Report**

### Enter claim identifier

On **Step 1: Claim Number**, enter a claim number, file number, or any identifier you use to track this claim. This helps keep reports organized when managing multiple claims and will be used in your report title and saved analysis list.

### Proceed to next step

Click **Policy Documents** to proceed to Step 2.

---

## 3) Upload policy documents

On **Step 2: Policy Documents**, add the insured's insurance policy or policies:

### Add policy documents

You can add documents in two ways:

- Click **Search and Add Documents From Vault** to pull a previously uploaded policy from your Vault, or
- Drag and drop files into the **Drop files here** area, or click to select files from your computer.

### Verify document compatibility

Supported file types include PDF, Word, Excel, and image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF). You can include up to 1000 pages total across all documents.

### Let Qumis process the documents

Qumis automatically reads and indexes each policy section—including coverage parts, endorsements, and definitions.

---

## 4) Upload the claim fact pattern

On **Step 3: Fact Patterns**, add documents describing the claim facts:

### Upload claim documentation

Add documents using the same methods as Step 2: search Vault or drag/drop from your computer.

Examples of documents to upload:

- First Notice of Loss (FNOL)
- Complaint or lawsuit
- Demand letter
- Reservation of Rights (ROR) letter
- Claim denial or response letter
- Medical records or incident reports
- Any other documentation describing the claim facts

### Provide comprehensive details

The more details you provide about the claim, the better Qumis can determine how specific policy provisions may apply or fail to apply.

---

## 5) Add additional context (optional)

On **Step 4: Additional Information**, you can provide optional context about the claim or coverage questions:

### Navigate to additional information

Click **Additional Information** on the left or click the **Additional Information** button to proceed to Step 4.

### Add coverage context

In the text box, you can add context such as:

- Specific coverage questions you want analyzed
- Focus areas (e.g., "Analyze whether this claim would trigger the Cyber coverage")
- Relevant policy provisions (e.g., "Focus on exclusions for professional services")
- Definitions to clarify (e.g., "Compare this fact pattern to the policy's wrongful act definition")
- Any coverage disputes or concerns

Providing context ensures the analysis targets your key concerns.

---

## 6) Generate your report

Once all required documents are uploaded and optional context is added:

### Initiate report generation

Click **Generate Coverage Report** at the bottom right. Qumis begins reading, correlating, and analyzing the policy language in light of the facts provided.

### Monitor progress

The process typically takes 5–10 minutes. You'll see a progress screen with status updates.

### Wait for completion

Qumis uses a multi-agent AI workflow to ensure reliability, context accuracy, and deep cross-referencing between policy and claim documents. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

---

## 7) Review your completed report

When the report is ready, Qumis provides a **Detailed Coverage Analysis** explaining:

**Detailed Coverage Analysis**

- Overview of the policy and the claim facts
- Summary of the parties involved
- Identification of relevant coverage provisions

**Coverage Determination Analysis**

- How the claim relates to the policy terms
- Which clauses or exclusions are relevant
- Whether coverage likely applies
- Key reasoning behind each determination
- Specific policy language supporting the analysis

Each section references specific policy provisions, helping you understand how coverage (or denial) was reached.

---

## 8) Chat with your report

Each claim report includes an interactive **Qumis Clerk** chat assistant that helps you explore coverage questions in more depth.

You can ask follow-up questions such as:

- "Does this claim trigger the policy's insuring agreement?"
- "Which exclusions apply here?"
- "Why did Qumis determine the claim is not covered?"
- "Show me where 'wrongful act' is defined in the policy."
- "What is the relevant exclusion and does it apply to these facts?"
- "Help me rebut the carrier's denial."

Chats are automatically saved, and you can maintain multiple chat threads per claim, allowing ongoing exploration and updates as the claim develops.

---

## 9) Use the report for coverage decisions and disputes

Once you have your Claim Analysis Report, use it strategically:

### For assessing complex claims

- Quickly understand which policy provisions apply to the claim facts
- Identify coverage triggers and any conditions the insured must meet
- Understand how specific policy language relates to the claim

### For rebutting claim denials

- Analyze the carrier's denial reasoning against the policy language
- Use the detailed analysis to support your Request for Reconsideration
- Cite specific policy provisions and coverage analysis in your rebuttal
- Provide the analysis to counsel if litigation is anticipated

### For supporting insureds

- Share the analysis to explain coverage (or lack of coverage) to the insured
- Use the report to educate the insured about relevant policy provisions
- Help the insured understand why coverage applies or doesn't apply

### For team and client communication

- Document your coverage reasoning and analysis
- Reference specific policy provisions in communications with carriers
- Provide professional, AI-backed coverage opinions to insureds and counsel

---

## 10) Access previous analyses

Your previously generated Claim Analysis Reports are saved and listed on the Claims dashboard.

### Navigate to Claims dashboard

Go to **Claims** in the left sidebar.

### View your reports

You'll see a table of all your analyses showing:

- NAME — Report name or claim identifier
- FILES — The policy and claim documents analyzed
- LAST MODIFIED — When the analysis was created or last accessed

### Open a saved analysis

Click any analysis to open it, review the coverage analysis, or add new chat questions.

---

## Best practices

- **Be thorough with claim facts.** Upload all relevant documentation (complaint, ROR, denial letter, medical records, etc.) so Qumis has complete context.
- **Include all relevant policies.** Upload all policies that might respond to the claim (primary, excess, umbrella, etc.).
- **Use the claim number consistently.** Use the same claim number each time you reference this claim for easy tracking and organization.
- **Add context about coverage questions.** If there's a specific coverage issue you want to focus on, mention it in Additional Information.
- **Review high-impact provisions first.** Focus on the most important coverage provisions that determine whether the claim should be covered.
- **Use chat for specific questions.** If coverage analysis is unclear, ask Qumis about specific policy language or how it applies to the facts.
- **Save important conversations.** Keep chat threads that explain your coverage reasoning for file documentation.
- **Document your analysis.** Use the report as documentation of your coverage analysis and reasoning.

---

## Time savings example

**Traditional claim analysis (typical):**

- Read and understand the policy: 30-60 minutes
- Review claim documentation and facts: 30-60 minutes
- Analyze policy provisions against claim facts: 1-2 hours
- Identify relevant exclusions and conditions: 30-60 minutes
- Form coverage opinion and document: 30-60 minutes
- **Total: 3-5 hours per claim analysis**

**With Qumis Claim Analysis Report:**

- Enter claim number: 1 minute
- Upload documents: 3 minutes
- Add context: 2 minutes
- Generate report: 5-10 minutes
- Review analysis and ask clarifying questions: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 16-26 minutes per claim analysis**

You can now complete multiple claim analyses in the time it would have taken to complete one manually.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My report didn't generate

Ensure you uploaded both policy and fact pattern documents. Both are required for analysis.

### My report is taking too long to generate

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or check that all documents uploaded successfully.

### I uploaded a claim but didn't get a coverage determination

Try providing more context under Additional Information—such as claim type, specific policy provisions to focus on, or coverage issues in dispute.

### The analysis doesn't address my coverage question

Use the chat feature to ask Qumis about specific coverage provisions or how they apply to your claim facts.

### Can I analyze multiple claims for the same policy?

Yes. Create separate reports for different claims using different claim numbers and different fact patterns.

### Can I export the analysis?

Yes. Use the Download button in the top-right corner of your completed report.

### Where are my past analyses?

All completed analyses appear on the **Claims dashboard**. Go to **Claims** in the left sidebar to access them.

---

## Where Claim Analysis Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Claim Analysis Report** is essential for claims professionals and coverage counsel. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc coverage questions, **Single Policy Analysis** for detailed individual policy review, and **Comparisons** for comparing multiple policies' responses to the same claim.

---

### Why use Claim Analysis Reports?

Claims analysis and coverage opinions require detailed policy review and fact analysis—critical work that is time-consuming and complex. With Qumis, analyzing coverage for a complex claim takes minutes, not hours. You can quickly understand how a policy responds to specific fact patterns, identify the reasoning behind potential coverage or exclusions, and support insureds or internal advocacy with AI-backed coverage opinions. The result is faster claim resolution, better-informed coverage decisions, and stronger support for claim denials or rebuttal of coverage disputes.

# Comparison Report

Source: reports/comparisons

> **Info:** The **Comparison Report** enables producers and brokers to compare multiple insurance policies, quotes, or binders side by side. Qumis reads and analyzes all uploaded documents, then generates a comprehensive coverage table—detailing key differences in coverages, exclusions, conditions, and policy language—all in minutes instead of days.

---

## What this report does

This tool is ideal when you need to compare:

- A quote vs. the incumbent's policy
- A renewal vs. alternative market quotes
- Multiple binders or applications
- Any other combination of documents where you want to identify meaningful differences

Qumis automatically:

- Compares and analyzes each document in detail
- Highlights coverage differences, exclusions, and conditions
- Evaluates policy language to explain implications for the insured
- Generates a Coverage Table showing side-by-side results, filterable by confidence and impact
- Lets you chat with the report for deeper insights into specific findings

---

## Before you start

> **Note:** **Prerequisites:**
>

6. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

### Review your comparison results

When complete, the **Comparison Dashboard** will display an interactive overview of your results with multiple tabs to explore:

- **Report** — Written analysis and findings
- **Visuals** — QumisScore benchmark and coverage alignment chart
- **Documents** — Source documents used for the analysis

### Understand the QumisScore

The **Visuals** tab includes the **QumisScore**—Qumis's AI-generated benchmark comparing how each policy performs across six key dimensions:

- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance** — How well the policy aligns with legal requirements
- **Exclusions and Endorsements** — Breadth and restrictiveness of exclusions versus added coverages
- **Policy Conditions and Definitions** — Clarity and favorability of terms and conditions
- **Claims Handling and Customer Service** — Carrier reputation and claim process quality
- **Cost and Insurer's Financial Stability** — Premium value and carrier financial strength
- **Coverage Alignment with Company Risks and Needs** — How well coverage matches business exposures

Each policy receives a QumisScore from 0-100 relative to the other documents you're comparing. This benchmarking shows which policy is stronger overall and on which specific dimensions, making it easy to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of different options.

The **Coverage Alignment chart** visualizes these six dimensions as a spider/radar chart, giving you a quick visual comparison of how policies stack up against each other.

### Overview metrics

**Match Overview**

- Full Match — identical terms across documents
- Partial Match — similar but different terms
- No Match — terms present in one document but not the other

**Impact Analysis**

- Categorizes differences as Low, Medium, or High impact
- High-impact differences highlighted in red for urgent review

**Action Items**

- Tracks key areas that require your review or client discussion
- Medium impact items (orange) and high impact items (red)

These insights highlight where material differences exist and where coverage improvements could be negotiated.

### Explore the coverage comparison table

The **Coverage Table** displays each field and clause side by side—showing how each document treats the same concept.

Each row includes:

- Field Name (e.g., "General Aggregate Limit")
- The value or clause language from each document
- A status indicator (Match, Partial, or Mismatch)
- Warning icons highlighting significant differences

### Filters and search

The Coverage Table is fully interactive with multiple filtering options:

- **Status filter** — Show only Matches, Partials, or Mismatches
- **Impact filter** — Focus on Low, Medium, or High impact differences
- **Confidence filter** — Filter by Qumis's confidence level in each match
- **Search bar** — Search for specific fields or coverage types
- **Qumis Insights toggle** — Turn on natural-language explanations of key differences and their implications for the insured

### Download the comparison table

Click the **Download** button in the upper right to export your results to Excel.

This allows you to:

- Add your own notes and commentary
- Include the table in client-facing materials
- Highlight negotiation points for renewals or marketing
- Customize formatting for presentations

The downloaded file mirrors the on-screen table and is ideal for client presentations or renewal strategy decks.

### Chat with your comparison report

Like other Qumis reports, you can chat directly with your comparison to dive deeper into specific findings.

### Asking questions

You can ask questions such as:

- "Where does Policy B have narrower coverage than Policy A?"
- "Which exclusions differ significantly between these two documents?"
- "Explain the impact of the pollution exclusion in both policies."
- "What coverage improvements does the new quote provide?"

Qumis answers based on all documents in the comparison with specific citations.

### Saving chat conversations

- Chats are automatically saved within your report
- You can maintain multiple chat threads per comparison for different topics or scenarios
- Access your saved chat conversations by clicking the chat history
- Reference saved conversations later when refining your recommendations

### Use the QumisScore in your recommendations

The QumisScore is a powerful tool for illustrating policy value to your clients:

**For competitive positioning**

- Show clients which option scores highest overall and on which specific dimensions
- Explain why a higher-scoring policy might be worth the premium difference
- Highlight specific dimension scores where one policy significantly outperforms others

**For identifying improvement opportunities**

- Use dimension scores to identify which areas are weak across all options
- Recommend additional coverage or endorsements to address low-scoring dimensions
- Show where negotiation with carriers could strengthen the policy

**For client education**

- Use the spider chart visual to educate clients on what makes a policy strong
- Explain each of the six dimensions in plain language
- Help clients understand that the highest score doesn't necessarily mean the best fit—context matters

> **Note:** **Important context**
>
> - QumisScore benchmarks policies relative to each other, not against a global standard
> - A score of 81 doesn't mean "81% perfect"—it means this policy scores higher on these dimensions compared to the other documents in your comparison
> - Always combine QumisScore insights with your professional judgment about the client's specific needs

### Use the comparison for your pitch

Once you have your Comparison Report, use it strategically:

**For quote presentations**

- Show exactly how your quote differs from the incumbent policy
- Highlight areas where you provide better coverage
- Point out where you've negotiated better pricing or terms
- Demonstrate value through professional side-by-side analysis

**For renewal discussions**

- Compare renewal terms to market quotes obtained after going to market
- Show if renewal terms are competitive or if alternatives are available
- Identify what's changed from prior years
- Recommend best option based on coverage and pricing analysis

**For competitive analysis**

- Compare multiple competing quotes objectively
- Show pros and cons of each option
- Recommend the best fit for the prospect's specific needs

**Build credibility**

- The detailed analysis shows you've done thorough due diligence
- Side-by-side comparisons make complex information digestible
- Professional formatting enhances your advisory authority

### Access previous comparisons

Your previously generated Comparison Reports are saved and listed on the Comparisons dashboard.

1. Go to **Comparisons** in the left sidebar.

You can now compare multiple competitive options or conduct market analysis in a single afternoon instead of days.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My comparison is taking too long to generate

Average time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload the documents.

### I uploaded only one file

You must upload at least two documents to generate a comparison.

### I need to upload more than two documents

Qumis supports multiple document comparisons. Add as many documents as you need (up to 1000 pages total). The report will analyze all of them.

### The results seem incomplete

Try toggling filters or enabling Qumis Insights for more contextual explanations. Some fields may be specific to certain policy types and may not appear across all documents.

### Can I compare more than two documents?

Yes. You can upload multiple quotes or binders for multi-way comparisons.

### Where are my past comparisons?

All completed comparisons appear on the **Comparisons dashboard**. Go to **Comparisons** in the left sidebar to access them.

### Can I add or remove documents from an existing comparison?

Create a new comparison to include or exclude different documents. Each comparison is a fixed analysis of the documents included at generation time.

### I want to compare documents with my team

Download the comparison to Excel and share with team members. You can also use the Shared Vault to store documents so your team can access them for their own comparisons.

---

## Where Comparison Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Comparison Report** complements **Single Policy Analysis** for individual policy review and **Chats** for ad-hoc questions. Use it whenever you need to evaluate multiple documents against each other to make informed recommendations to prospects and clients.

---

### Why use Comparison Reports?

Policy comparisons are critical during renewal, prospecting, or marketing phases—but traditionally take hours or days to complete. With Qumis, you can compare hundreds of pages in minutes, quickly see where a quote differs from the incumbent, identify coverage gaps and opportunities, and produce professional client-ready materials in less time. By reading every clause and condition, Qumis reveals what's different, why it matters, and how it affects your insured—empowering brokers and producers to make faster, more informed recommendations. What once required extensive manual work now takes just minutes, helping you win renewals, identify upsell opportunities, and strengthen client trust.

# Contract Review

Source: reports/contract-review

> **Info:** The **Contract Review Report** helps account managers and service teams quickly determine whether an insured's policies, certificates, or quotes meet the insurance requirements outlined in a contract, lease, or agreement. Qumis automates the compliance review process—reading both documents, comparing requirements against coverages, and clearly identifying which requirements are compliant, non-compliant, or ambiguous—all in minutes instead of hours.

---

## What this report does

Qumis supports multiple types of contract analysis. Select the type that best matches your review scenario:

- **Contract Review** — General review of insurance requirements vs. policy documents.
- **Contract Compliance Review** — Detailed compliance validation of policy terms against requirements.
- **COI vs. Requirements** — Compare a Certificate of Insurance (COI) to contract requirements.
- **Lease & Agreement Analysis** — Analyze lease language for insurance compliance and liability clauses.
- **Construction Contracts** — Review construction agreements for indemnification and liability provisions.

The workflow is the same for all report types. Qumis automates compliance verification by reading both the contract and insurance materials, matching requirements clause by clause, and identifying coverage gaps.

---

## Before you start

> **Note:** **Prerequisites:**
>
> - Have the contract or agreement document ready (the document containing insurance requirements).
> - Have the client's insurance documentation ready (policy, COI, quote, or evidence of coverage).

## 6) Review your completed report

When complete, you'll see the **Compliance Comparison Report** with the following structure:

### Report tabs

- **Report** — The full compliance analysis (default view)
- **Documents** — The source contract and insurance documents used for the analysis

### Compliance Comparison Table

The report includes a structured table that summarizes:

**Contractual Requirement** — Extracted requirement from the contract (e.g., "General Liability: $1M per occurrence").

**Policy Details** — The corresponding coverage or limit found in the insurance documents.

**Compliance Level** — Status indicator showing:

- Compliant — Coverage meets or exceeds the requirement
- Non-Compliant — Coverage does not meet the requirement or is missing
- Ambiguous — Requirement or coverage is unclear and may need clarification
- Not Available — Information is not available to make a determination

**Notes** — Provides context, explanation, or verification details.

This view makes it easy to identify coverage gaps, confirm compliance, and prepare recommendations for your client.

## Best practices

- **Use the right report type.** Select the Contract Review type that best matches your situation for more targeted analysis.
- **Include all relevant documents.** Upload both the contract requirements and all insurance documentation so Qumis can make a complete assessment.
- **Add context about special situations.** If there are unique circumstances, explain them in Additional Information so Qumis can provide better analysis.
- **Review compliance items systematically.** Go through the report in order, starting with high-priority items like limits and additional insured requirements.
- **Use chat for clarification.** If a compliance determination is unclear, ask Qumis to explain the specific contract language or coverage provision.
- **Follow up on ambiguous items.** When a requirement is marked as ambiguous, use the Notes to understand what clarification is needed, then follow up with the carrier or client.
- **Save chat conversations.** Keep important Q\&A threads in the report as documentation of your compliance review.
- **Track changes over time.** When a client brings something into compliance, generate a new report to document the resolution.

---

## Time savings example

**Traditional compliance review (typical):**

- Read and understand contract requirements: 30-60 minutes
- Review insurance documents: 30-60 minutes

---

## Troubleshooting

### I only uploaded a contract, and the system won't generate a report.

You must upload at least one insurance-related document to perform a compliance review.

### My report is taking too long to generate.

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or check that all documents uploaded successfully.

### The report shows 'Ambiguous' results.

This indicates unclear or missing information. Use the chat feature to ask Qumis for clarification, or verify and upload an updated COI or policy version.

### Can I analyze multiple contracts at once?

Each report supports one contract set at a time for maximum accuracy. Create separate reports for different contracts.

### Where are my saved reports?

All generated reports appear on the **Contracts dashboard** under their respective category. Go to **Contracts** in the left sidebar to access them.

---

## Where Contract Review Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Contract Review Report** is essential for account management and client service teams. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc questions about specific requirements or coverage, and **Single Policy Analysis** for deeper analysis of specific policies when needed.

---

## Why use Contract Review Reports?

> **Info:** Insurance compliance verification is critical but time-consuming work. Qumis simplifies complex compliance reviews by analyzing both contracts and coverage evidence, summarizing requirements, identifying compliance status, and highlighting next steps. With Qumis, a task that once took hours now takes minutes—enabling your team to deliver faster, more accurate service and strengthen client trust while focusing on strategic advisory work instead of manual document review.

# Coverage Table

Source: reports/coverage-table

> **Info:** The **Coverage Table** feature helps brokers, account managers, and producers quickly create a side-by-side coverage summary for one or more insurance policies. Qumis reads your uploaded policy documents, extracts the relevant terms and conditions, and presents them in a structured, professional comparison table that's easy to share with clients.

---

## What this report does

The Coverage Table provides a clear, line-by-line view of coverage features across one or more policies. It's most helpful when preparing proposals, renewals, or side-by-side comparisons for clients.

With this report, you can:

- Extract coverage details, limits, and terms directly from uploaded policies or quotes.
- Compare key terms such as limits, retentions, and coverages across multiple documents.
- Identify where the language matches, differs, or requires review.
- Download the finished report for inclusion in client-facing materials.

It's best to create separate Coverage Table reports for each line of business (e.g., Cyber, General Liability, Property) using a relevant checklist.

---

## Before you start

- Have at least one policy document ready (quote, policy, binder, or application).
- If comparing multiple documents, have them all ready to upload (1-5 documents supported).
- Decide whether to use automatic extraction or a custom coverage checklist.
- If using a custom checklist, have your list of fields ready or saved in the Prompt Library.

---

### Access the Coverage Table tool

1. From the sidebar, click **Coverage Table (BETA)**.
2. You'll see a list of existing reports and the option to start a new one.
3. Click **Create Coverage Table** to begin.

Each generated table is saved automatically for future reference.

### Upload your policy documents

A three-step workflow guides you through creating your coverage table:

- **Step 1: Policy Documents**
- **Step 2: Add Checklist Items**
- **Step 3: Generate Report**

On **Step 1: Policy Documents**, add the documents you want to analyze:

1. You can add documents in two ways:
   - Click **Search and Add Documents From Vault** to pull previously uploaded documents from your Vault, or
   - Drag and drop files into the **Drop files here** area, or click to select files from your computer.
2. Supported file types include PDF, Word, Excel, and images (JPG, PNG, TIFF).
3. You can upload between 1 and 5 policy documents.
4. Qumis reads and parses the uploaded documents to extract key coverage items.

### Add checklist items

On **Step 2: Add Checklist Items**, choose how you want Qumis to build your coverage table.

You have two options:

### Option A — Auto-Generate Checklist (Recommended for beginners)

1. Toggle **Auto-Generate Checklist Items** **on** (enabled).
2. Qumis will automatically identify relevant fields and terms based on the uploaded documents.
3. This is the fastest way to create a table if you don't have a checklist defined.

### Option B — Use a Defined Checklist

1. Toggle **Auto-Generate Checklist Items** **off** (disabled).
2. You now have two ways to add your checklist:

**Method 1: Type or paste your checklist**

- Copy and paste the checklist items from your proposal template or coverage checklist.
- Enter the list of coverage items, limits, and/or terms you want to include in the coverage table.
- Example fields include:
  - Policy Term
  - Carrier
  - Intermediary
  - AM Best Rating
  - Coverage limits and deductibles
  - Specific coverage types relevant to the line of business

**Method 2: Use a saved checklist from Prompt Library**

- If you've saved your coverage checklists to the Prompt Library, click the **book icon**.
- Select the appropriate checklist from your saved prompts.
- The checklist fields will populate automatically.

### Best practices for checklist creation

### Create line-of-business-specific checklists

- Create separate Coverage Table reports for each line of business (e.g., General Liability, Commercial Property, Workers Compensation, Cyber).
- Use checklists that ask for information relevant to that specific line of business.
- Don't use your General Liability checklist on a Commercial Property policy—the fields won't match.

### Save frequently-used checklists

- Save your most-used coverage checklists to the Prompt Library for quick reuse.
- Name them clearly (e.g., "GL Coverage Checklist," "Commercial Property Limits and Deductibles").
- Update them as your proposals or client needs evolve.
- If you'd like your agency's standard checklists added to the Prompt Library for all users in your organization to access, contact your customer success manager.

### Include relevant fields

- Policy information (carrier, term, admitted status, ratings)
- Key limits and sublimits
- Deductibles and retentions
- Important coverage types and endorsements
- Territory and jurisdictional information

### Generate your coverage table

Once documents are uploaded and checklist items are defined:

1. Click **Generate Coverage Table** at the bottom right.
2. Qumis begins analyzing the uploaded documents, matching field values across policies, and identifying alignment or discrepancies.
3. Report generation typically takes 5–10 minutes as Qumis validates and extracts data using a multi-agent AI process.
4. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

### Review your completed coverage table

When ready, the coverage table displays each policy side by side with fields such as:

- Writing Company
- AM Best Rating
- Effective Dates
- Limits and Retentions
- Coverage Inclusions and Exclusions

Each row indicates the status of that field:

- **Match** — Values are aligned across policies.
- **Partial** — Some differences exist.
- **Mismatch** — Policies differ on key details.

You can sort or filter by status, impact, or confidence level for quick review.

---

## 7) Chat with your coverage table

Each coverage table includes an interactive chat assistant powered by **Qumis Clerk**.

You can ask questions such as:

- "Which limits differ across these policies?"
- "What's the main difference between the two carriers?"
- "Show me where the Cyber Extortion coverage is located."
- "Explain the cyber coverage limits in each document."
- "What exclusions differ between these quotes?"

Chats are saved, and you can create multiple threads per table, making collaboration and deep dives effortless.

---

## 8) Download your coverage table

When satisfied, click **Download** to export the table for inclusion in client presentations or proposal documents.

The exported coverage table provides a professional summary of your analysis that can be shared with clients or underwriters. You can:

- Add the table to your client proposals
- Include it in renewal presentations
- Customize formatting for your brand
- Add your own notes and recommendations

---

## 9) Use the coverage table in client presentations

Once you have your Coverage Table, use it to:

**For quote presentations**

- Show clients side-by-side coverage comparisons of competing quotes
- Highlight where one option provides better coverage or value
- Demonstrate which insurer offers the best fit for their needs

**For renewal discussions**

- Compare renewal terms to expiring policy
- Show what's changing year-over-year
- Identify coverage improvements or areas of concern

**For marketing and proposals**

- Create professional coverage summaries for prospects
- Demonstrate thoroughness and expertise
- Provide clear documentation of coverage options

**Build credibility**

- Professional formatting shows attention to detail
- Clear comparisons make complex information accessible
- AI-backed extraction ensures accuracy

---

## 10) Access previous coverage tables

Your previously generated Coverage Tables are saved and listed on the Coverage Table dashboard.

1. Go to **Coverage Table** in the left sidebar.
2. You'll see a table of all your coverage tables showing:
   - NAME — Table name
   - FILES — The documents analyzed
   - LAST MODIFIED — When the table was created or last accessed
3. Click any table to open it, review the comparison, download it, or add new chat questions.

---

## Best practices

- **One line of business per table.** Create separate tables for GL, Property, Workers Comp, Cyber, etc., to ensure relevant fields are extracted.
- **Use saved checklists for consistency.** Save your frequently-used checklists to Prompt Library so you can reuse them across multiple clients.
- **Match checklist to documents.** Make sure your checklist asks for fields that actually exist in the documents you're analyzing.
- **Start with auto-generate.** If you're new to Coverage Tables or unsure what to extract, use auto-generate first to see what Qumis finds.
- **Review Partial and Mismatch rows closely.** These highlight coverage differences that are important to discuss with clients.
- **Refine over time.** After running a few tables, refine your checklists to focus on the fields most important to your clients.
- **Download for proposals.** Always download the table to include in professional client-facing materials.
- **Use chat for clarification.** If extracted information seems unclear, ask Qumis to explain specific fields or coverage provisions.
- **Combine multiple reports.** Create separate tables for each line of business and include them all in comprehensive proposals.

---

## Time savings example

**Traditional coverage table creation (typical):**

- Read through each policy document: 30-60 minutes
- Extract coverage limits and terms: 1-2 hours
- Create comparison table in Excel: 30-60 minutes
- Format for client presentation: 30-45 minutes
- **Total: 2.5-4.5 hours per coverage table**

**With Qumis Coverage Table Report:**

- Upload documents: 2 minutes
- Select or create checklist: 2-3 minutes
- Generate table: 5-10 minutes
- Review and download: 3-5 minutes
- **Total: 12-20 minutes per coverage table**

> **Tip:** You can now create multiple professional coverage tables in the time it would have taken to create one manually.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My table didn't extract the information I expected

Check that your checklist fields match what's actually in the documents. If you asked for "Cyber Limits" but uploaded a GL policy, Qumis won't find that information.

### Some fields show 'Not Available'

This means Qumis couldn't find that information in the document. The field may not exist in that policy, or it may be described differently.

### My coverage table is taking too long to generate

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload the documents.

### How do I create a checklist for a new line of business?

Look at a sample policy for that line and list all the key coverage items, limits, deductibles, and terms you want to track. Save it as a prompt for future use.

### Can I compare more than 5 documents?

No, Coverage Table supports 1-5 documents per table. If you need to compare more, create multiple tables.

### Where are my saved checklists?

Checklists saved to the Prompt Library can be accessed by clicking the book icon during checklist creation.

### Can I edit the table after it's generated?

You can download the table and edit it in Excel or your preferred tool. The table in Qumis is fixed once generated.

---

## Where Coverage Table fits in the Qumis platform

The **Coverage Table** complements **Comparisons** for policy-level differences and **Single Policy Analysis** for detailed individual policy review. Use Coverage Tables when you need clean, client-ready summaries of coverage information to include in proposals and presentations.

---

### Why use Coverage Table?

The Coverage Table simplifies what used to be a manual, time-intensive process of reviewing and comparing multiple policies. With Qumis, you can generate consistent, professional coverage summaries in minutes, identify coverage gaps or differences instantly, and provide clear, visual insights to clients and producers. Transform your policy comparison workflow—from manual spreadsheets to AI-powered precision.

### Example: Writing an effective prompt

Here's an example of how a detailed, context-rich prompt might look:

*"You will be provided with 1 document: General liability insurance policy for a construction company operating in the Southeastern United States.*

*Task: Analyze the provided general liability insurance policy for a construction company offering general construction, design/build, construction management, and upfit/renovation services in the Southeastern United States. The analysis should be comprehensive and objective, identifying potential biases or limitations in the policy's coverage. The report should be suitable for a construction company executive seeking to understand the policy's strengths and weaknesses. The analysis should focus on the following aspects:*

- *Named Insureds: List all named insureds and verify their accuracy.*
- *Coverage Territory: Clearly define the geographical coverage of the policy.*
- *Class Codes and Exposures: Create a table listing all class codes, their corresponding exposure bases, and the locations they apply to.*
- *Policy Form: Determine if the policy is occurrence-based, claims-made, or claims-made and reported. Justify your conclusion.*
- *Limits, Deductibles, and Retentions: List all policy limits, deductibles, and retentions, clarifying their application..."*

> **Tip:** The more specific your prompt, the more precise and useful your report will be.

## Best practices

- **Be specific in your prompts.** The more detailed your instructions, the better Qumis can tailor the output to your needs.
- **Define your audience.** Specify whether the report is for executives, underwriters, clients, or internal use—this affects tone and detail level.
- **Keep prompts focused on a single objective** (e.g., exclusions analysis, policy comparison) for clearer results.
- **Request specific formats.** If you want tables, bullet points, or particular section structures, state this clearly in your prompt.
- **Upload relevant, complete documents** for more accurate results.
- **Save successful prompts.** When you create a prompt that works well, save it to the Prompt Library for future use.
- **Iterate and refine.** If the first report isn't quite right, use the chat feature to refine the analysis, then update your prompt for next time.
- **Use for unique situations.** Custom Reports excel when standard report types don't quite fit your needs.
- **Leverage the magic wand.** Use the magic wand icon to refine your prompt if you're unsure how to structure it.
- **Test with different formats.** Experiment with different prompt structures to find what works best for your use cases.

---

## Example prompts for different use cases

**For executive coverage summary:** *"Analyze this commercial property policy and create an executive summary suitable for a C-suite audience. Focus on: total limits and deductibles, major coverage grants, critical exclusions that create risk, and 3-5 key recommendations for coverage improvements. Use clear, non-technical language."*

**For regulatory compliance review:** *"Review this workers compensation policy for compliance with \[State] requirements. Create a checklist showing: required coverages (met/not met), statutory limits, mandatory endorsements, and any deficiencies that need immediate attention."*

**For prospect analysis:** *"Compare this prospect's current general liability policy to industry best practices for \[Industry]. Identify: coverage gaps, inadequate limits, missing endorsements, and 5 specific improvements we could provide. Format as a competitive analysis suitable for a sales presentation."*

**For coverage adequacy assessment:** *"Assess whether this cyber insurance policy adequately protects a \[Company Type] with \[Annual Revenue] in revenue. Evaluate: first-party vs third-party coverage balance, limits relative to company size, critical exclusions for this industry, and specific coverage enhancements needed."*

**For exclusions analysis:** *"Analyze the attached General Liability policy and identify all exclusions related to subcontractors. Summarize each exclusion in plain language and note whether the policy provides any exceptions or carve-backs. Present findings in bullet points."*

---

## Troubleshooting

### My report didn't produce the output I expected

- Review your prompt for clarity. Did you specify exactly what you wanted and how you wanted it formatted?
- Use the chat feature to ask Qumis to reformat or refocus specific sections.

### The report is too general or not detailed enough

- Your prompt may need more specificity. Add detailed instructions about what to analyze and how deep to go.
- Specify that you want "detailed" or "comprehensive" analysis with examples.

### My custom report is taking too long to generate

- Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. Very complex prompts may take longer.
- If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or simplify your prompt.

### I want to reuse a successful prompt

Save effective prompts to the Prompt Library so you can select them from the dropdown for future reports.

### Where are my past custom reports?

All completed reports appear on the **Custom Report dashboard**. Go to **Custom Report** in the left sidebar to access them.

### Can I update a report after it's generated?

The report itself is fixed, but you can use the chat feature to get additional analysis or clarifications, which are saved with the report.

---

## Where Custom Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Custom Report** is the most flexible tool in Qumis, filling the gaps when specialized analysis is needed beyond the standard report types. Use it alongside **Single Policy Analysis** for general policy reviews, **Comparisons** for side-by-side analysis, **Contract Reviews** for compliance checks, and **Claims Analysis** for coverage opinions—but turn to Custom Reports when you need something uniquely tailored to your situation.

---

### Why use Custom Reports?

The Custom Report is Qumis's most flexible report type — giving you full control over the scope, tone, and depth of the analysis powered by Qumis's deep reasoning and contextual understanding of insurance policies.

Use it when you need:

- A **tailored deep-dive** into one or more policies
- To **automate repetitive reporting** tasks
- Or to create **client-ready deliverables** using Qumis's deep policy understanding

Custom Reports give you the power to create exactly the analysis you need, formatted precisely for your audience. Whether you're preparing executive summaries, conducting specialized industry analysis, or creating unique client deliverables, Custom Reports let you leverage Qumis's deep analytical capabilities while maintaining complete control over the output. The result is professional, tailored insurance analysis that would take hours to produce manually, delivered in minutes and ready for your specific use case.

> **Tip:** The Custom Report unlocks the full analytical power of Qumis — driven entirely by your expertise and creativity.

## 7) Use the report for your pitch

Once you have your Single Policy Analysis Report, use it to:

- Reference specific weaknesses and gaps to show where current coverage is inadequate
- Recommend coverage improvements based on Qumis's analysis
- Highlight where you can negotiate better terms

* Use specific policy sections and exclusions cited in the report
* Show you've done your homework by referencing details from their existing policy
* Demonstrate value by explaining what's missing or could be improved

- The detailed analysis gives you credibility and expertise
- Speak authoritatively about their coverage without lengthy manual review
- Use the chat feature to answer follow-up questions before your pitch

---

## 8) Download or share

### Export as PDF

Click **Download** in the top right of the completed report to export it as a professional PDF.

### Share with stakeholders

Share insights with your team or clients for quick follow-up and discussion.

Downloaded reports include your company name and Qumis analysis notes—ideal for client presentations.

---

## 9) Access previous reports

Your previously generated Single Policy Analysis Reports are saved and listed on the Single Policy Analysis dashboard.

### Navigate to Single Policy

Go to **Single Policy** in the left sidebar.

### Review your reports table

You'll see a table of all your reports showing:

- **NAME** — Report name
- **FILES** — The policy file analyzed
- **LAST MODIFIED** — When the report was created or last accessed

### Open a saved report

Click any report to open it, review the analysis, or add new chat questions.

---

## Best practices

### Add context for better analysis

The more detail you provide in "Additional Information," the more targeted Qumis's analysis will be. Include industry specifics, operational details, and focus areas.

### Review before pitching

Always review the full report before meeting with the prospect so you understand the nuances of their coverage and can speak confidently.

### Use chat to prepare

Ask Qumis clarifying questions about exclusions, limits, and terms before your pitch so you're fully prepared for client questions.

### Highlight the wins

Focus your pitch on opportunities where your firm can provide better coverage, more favorable terms, or cost savings. Use specific examples from the report.

### Save your conversations

Keep your chat threads with the report—they become part of your analysis file and help with consistency across multiple client touchpoints.

### One policy per report

Create separate analyses for each policy so reports stay organized and focused. For side-by-side comparisons, use the Comparisons feature.

---

## Time savings example

**5-9 hours per policy**

- Initial policy review: 1-2 hours
- Detailed coverage analysis: 2-3 hours
- Identifying gaps and opportunities: 1-2 hours
- Preparing pitch materials: 1-2 hours

**15-25 minutes per policy**

- Upload policy: 2 minutes
- Add context: 2 minutes
- Generate report: 5-10 minutes
- Review and ask clarifying questions: 5-10 minutes

> **Tip:** **Dramatic efficiency gains:** You can now analyze multiple prospect policies in a single afternoon instead of days—giving you more time to focus on building relationships and winning accounts.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My report is taking too long to generate

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload your document. Complex or lengthy policies may take slightly longer.

### I don't see my uploaded document

Ensure you've added it in the "Policy Documents" section (Step 1) before clicking "Generate Report." Check that the file shows a green checkmark and document name after upload.

### Can I analyze more than one policy at once?

The Single Policy tool is designed for one document at a time to ensure accuracy and focus. For side-by-side comparisons, use the **Comparisons** feature instead.

### Where are my past analyses?

All completed reports appear on the **Single Policy Analysis dashboard**. Go to **Single Policy** in the left sidebar to access them. Reports show name, associated files, and last modified date.

### Can I edit the report after it's generated?

The report itself is generated by Qumis and cannot be directly edited, but you can add notes and chat questions. Use the chat feature to clarify specific points or ask for deeper analysis on any section.

### I want to compare two policies

Create separate Single Policy Analysis reports for each policy, then use the **Comparisons** tool to review them side-by-side with detailed variance analysis.

---

## Where Single Policy Analysis fits in the Qumis platform

Single Policy Analysis is purpose-built for the broker/producer workflow of evaluating prospects' existing policies. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc questions, **Comparisons** for side-by-side policy reviews, and **Custom Reports** for tailored client deliverables.

---

### Why use Single Policy Analysis?

Traditional policy analysis can take hours or days—reading, annotating, comparing, and summarizing dense legal documents. With Qumis, you can analyze a full policy in minutes, identify coverage gaps and negotiation opportunities instantly, and position your firm as a trusted advisor to win new business faster. What once took days now takes minutes, letting you focus on relationships, not paperwork.

- Yes/No or single-choice fields

**Example format:**

```json
{"field_key": "value"}
```

**Examples:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Policy Number | `{"policy_number": "POL-2024-001"}` |
| Effective Date | `{"effective_date": "2024-01-15"}` |

| Named Insureds with Role | `[{"name": "ABC Corp", "role": "Primary"}, {"name": "XYZ Inc", "role": "Additional"}]` |

---

## Writing Good Instructions

The **instructions** field tells the AI how to find and extract the value. Good instructions lead to accurate extractions.

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Describe exactly what to look for
2. **List alternative names** - Include different terms that might be used
3. **Specify format** - Tell the AI how to format the output
4. **Provide context** - Explain where to look in the document

### Instruction Template

> **Note:** Extract \[what to find]. \[Where to look]. \[Format instructions]. \[Alternative terms].

### Examples

| Field | Good Instruction |
|-------|------------------|
| **Policy Number** | "Extract the unique policy identifier. Look in the declarations page header or policy information section. This may be labeled as 'Policy Number', 'Policy No.', 'Certificate Number', or 'Policy ID'." |
| **Effective Date** | "Extract the policy start date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). Look for 'Effective Date', 'Policy Period From', 'Inception Date', or 'Coverage Begins'. If only month/year is shown, use the 1st of the month." |
| **Deductible** | "Extract the per-occurrence deductible amount as a number without currency symbols. Look in the deductible schedule or declarations. May be labeled as 'Deductible', 'Retention', or 'Self-Insured Retention (SIR)'." |
| **Covered Perils** | "Extract all perils explicitly covered by the policy as an array. Look in the 'Covered Causes of Loss' or 'Insured Perils' section. Include both named perils and any 'all-risk' designation." |

---

> **Use Cases:** API documentation sites, code repositories, knowledge bases

### Documentation Sites

```markdown
You will be creating a Markdown file named llms-full.txt that contains all essential information from an input file, converted to clean Markdown.

Your task is to process this input and create a single Markdown file that follows these rules:

1. Begin with "# <Project Name>" on its own line.
2. Immediately follow with a concise 1-paragraph intro (no block-quote needed).
3. Inline the full Markdown of every important page in logical order (e.g. Quick Start, Concepts, API Reference, Guides).
4. Preserve headings (#–####), code fences, lists, tables, and images (![alt](url)). Strip any extraneous HTML, scripts, or navigation.
5. Do not add external links — inline the content instead.
6. Target ≤ 100 KB of output; summarise verbose or repetitive sections if needed, but keep code samples intact.

Follow these steps to create the output:
1. Identify the project name and create the top-level heading.
2. Write a concise 1-paragraph introduction summarizing the project.
3. Determine the logical order of important pages (e.g., Quick Start, Concepts, API Reference, Guides).
4. For each important page:
    a. Convert the content to clean Markdown.
    b. Preserve headings, code fences, lists, tables, and images.
    c. Remove any extraneous HTML, scripts, or navigation elements.
    d. Inline any external links by including the relevant content directly.
5. If the total content exceeds 100 KB, summarize verbose or repetitive sections while keeping code samples intact.

Provide your output as Markdown. The content of these tags should be exactly what would be written to the /llms-full.txt file, with no additional commentary or explanation.
```

### Code Repositories

```markdown
You will be creating a Markdown file named llms-full.txt that contains all essential information from a code repository, converted to clean Markdown format optimized for LLM consumption and understanding, with strategic content extraction rather than complete file dumps.

Your task is to process the repository input and create a single comprehensive Markdown file that follows these rules:

1. Begin with "# <Project Name>" on its own line.
2. Immediately follow with a concise 1-paragraph intro describing what the project does, its main purpose, and primary programming language(s) used.
3. Include a **System Architecture Overview** explaining the application pattern, key components, and data flow.
4. Add a **Module Dependencies Map** showing critical file relationships and import chains.
5. Include a comprehensive file structure overview with file type indicators and role descriptions.
6. Extract and present **key code segments** from important files in logical order following the priority hierarchy below.
7. For each file, use appropriate code fences with language specification and semantic markers.
8. Focus on **interfaces, signatures, core logic, and architectural patterns** rather than complete implementations.
9. Apply smart filtering and extraction strategies for optimal LLM comprehension.
10. Target ≤ 100 KB with dynamic adjustment, prioritizing understanding over completeness.

## Engineering Prompts

> **Info:** Prompts for code generation, review, debugging, and technical tasks.

### Self-Review

Perform comprehensive self-reviews to improve code quality and catch issues early. This two-step process helps LLMs evaluate and improve their own outputs.

> **Tip:** **Why This Works:** LLMs are more performant at review/analysis than one-shot generation
>
> **Best For:** Code reviews, documentation improvements, complex problem-solving
>
> **Pro Tip:** Run 2-3 iterations for best results - each review compounds the improvements

#### Step 1: Perform Self-Review

```markdown Review Last Message
Perform a comprehensive self-review of your LAST message and my message before that. First, describe the objective of what I had asked for and what you had replied with in your response. This process involves analyzing your response, evaluating relevant attributes, and providing constructive feedback for improvement. Your goal is to produce a thorough, objective, and actionable self-review. Add scores (0.0-10.0) for each of your evaluations then a final overall score.
```

```markdown Review Modifications (General)
Perform a comprehensive self-review. First, describe the objective of what I had asked for and what you had replied with in your response(s). This process involves analyzing your response(s), evaluating relevant attributes, and providing constructive feedback for improvement. Your goal is to produce a thorough, objective, and actionable self-review. Add scores (0.0-10.0) for each of your evaluations then a final overall score.
```

#### Step 2: Revise/Improve Output

```markdown
Review your previous analysis and apply the suggested improvements to the process described in the original content. Focus on enhancing the score for the attributes that you have scored, while maintaining the original intent and structure.
```

> **Note:** You can repeat the self-review process multiple times for iterative improvement. As noted by @Erik Nomitch: "Since LLMs are more performant at review/analysis than they are at one-shot generation, I find that doing this self-review process can drastically improve many types of outputs."

### Create Retool SQL Queries

Generate SQL queries specifically formatted for Qumis Retool applications with proper naming conventions and parameter syntax.

### Retool SQL Query Generator

> **Warning:** **Required Files:**
>
> - `schema.json` (available from Qumis engineering team)
>
> **Common Use Cases:**
>
> - Weekly/monthly aggregations
> - User analytics and metrics
> - Data validation queries
> - Organization-level reporting

Create a Retool query and name for: DESCRIPTION

Review the database schema defined in `schema.json` and use it for context.

You will return only the following:

- A query name following this naming convention: `q_[description][timeframe/type][grouping]`
- A PostgreSQL SQL statement, using Retool's `{{ }}` syntax for parameters
- Use only tables, columns, and enums that exist in `schema.json`

Examples of valid query names:

- `q_chats_weekly_count_by_org`
- `q_chats_weekly_count_by_user`
- `q_chats_6week_count_by_org`
- `q_chats_6week_count_by_user`
- `q_chat_data_validation`

**Format:**

Return your answer in a single code block like this:

```sql
-- name: q_example_query_type_group
SELECT * FROM example_table WHERE id = {{ id }};
```

Do not include any explanatory text—only the code block.

**Instructions:**

1. Add the `schema.json` file (available from the Qumis engineering team)
2. Replace `<DESCRIPTION>` with your query requirement
3. Run the prompt to generate the SQL query and name
4. In Retool, go to "Edit App" → "Code"
5. Duplicate an existing query
6. Replace the SQL with your generated query and rename it
7. Click Run to test

**Example Descriptions:**

- "The total number of chats, per organization, within the last 6 weeks"
- "The average number of users per organization"

### Backfilling Linear Issues

Convert code changes and commits into properly formatted Linear tickets for documentation.

#### Main Prompt

```markdown
# OBJECTIVE

I'd like to backfill our Linear issues with new tickets that are already done and in the codebase but don't exist in Linear yet.

Your objective is to review the code and data in the <CHANGES> tags and create Linear tickets (in Markdown format) from them.

Here are some examples of Linear tickets in Markdown:

[See examples below]

<CHANGES>
[Paste your code changes or commit history here]
</CHANGES>
```

#### Example Linear Tickets

```markdown Example 1: Upload Validation
# Only allows users to upload appropriate document types

Currently when a user goes to upload a document, the UI states only PDF format only however users are able to upload other types of documents such as .pngs that do not process correctly.

Users should only be allowed to upload .pdf
```

```markdown Example 2: Environment Badges
# Add persistent environment information badges

Implement status badges for all non-customer facing environments. This is to limit mistakes and increase flow speed.

Since we will all be switching deployment environments pretty frequently, we should have an indicator that we on a certain environment (unless it is production) in the header.

I don't want one of us to accidentally do something to our production environment when we think we are on dev, qa, uat, etc.

It should be persistent across all pages and and fixed with the top z-index.
```

## Operations Prompts

> **Info:** Prompts for infrastructure management, monitoring, and operational workflows.

### Alignment on Objective

Identify gaps in understanding between user intent and AI interpretation to improve task alignment.

### Alignment on Objective

```markdown
Review our interaction(s) so far. Think about the differences between:
- My understanding of what I've asked/prompted you for (should usually be a high level since it's in my mental model)
- Your understanding of my mental model transferred to you via chats and prompts.

This is an inherently lossy process. Identify potential gaps in our understanding of the objective. How can we reach parity?

First identify the potential differences in our understandings and anything that is ambiguous or unclear. Then come up with a list of questions for me which, if answered, will increase our likelihood of being aligned on what my true objective is. For each of the questions, add a score (0.0-1.0) of how much you think the answered question will improve our alignment on objective.
```

### Chat Dump

Create a comprehensive backup of conversation data for knowledge transfer or session restoration.

### Chat Dump

```markdown
Create a comprehensive JSON dump of all of the data so far in this conversation so that if given to you (or another LLM) in a new instance, you could "ingest" it and retain the knowledge from this entire conversation.
```

## Customer Support Prompts

> **Info:** Prompts for customer communication, issue resolution, and support workflows.

*Customer support prompts will be added as they are developed and tested with the Qumis support team.*

## Meta-Prompting Techniques

### Generate/Evaluate Method

A systematic approach to creating optimized prompts using the LLM's own capabilities to generate and evaluate prompts.

### Generate/Evaluate Method

> **Info:** **Best For:** Creating new prompts from scratch, optimizing existing prompts
>
> **Pro Tip:** Use the same model family as your target deployment for best results

This method leverages the LLM's weights to influence prompt generation and evaluation, often producing better results than manually crafted prompts.

**Process:**

1. **Generate a prompt engineering guide:**

   ```markdown
   Generate a detailed prompt engineering guide. The audience is <role>.
   ```

   (Example roles: "book authors", "software developers", "customer support reps")
2. **Provide few-shot examples:** Paste 5 examples of input/output pairs showing how you want the prompt to work
3. **Generate the prompt:**

   ```markdown
   Generate a prompt that could have generated the examples' outputs, and include a better set of examples.
   ```
4. **In a new chat, generate evaluation guide:**

   ```markdown
   Generate a detailed prompt evaluation guide. The audience is <role>.
   ```
5. **Evaluate the prompt:** Paste the generated prompt and instruct:

   ```markdown
   Evaluate the prompt.
   ```
6. **Generate alternatives:**

   ```markdown
   Generate 3 improved alternative prompts.
   ```
7. **Select and refine:** Choose the best alternative and edit as necessary

> **Tip:** Use a model from the same family as your target deployment for best results.

## Positioning Statement

Qumis is the coverage intelligence platform for commercial P\&C insurance professionals. Built by a licensed coverage attorney and AI experts, Qumis combines legal-grade policy analysis with proprietary market intelligence drawn from thousands of commercial insurance programs — delivering not just what a policy says, but what it means in the context of the broader market. Unlike generic AI tools that process documents or workflow automation platforms that move them faster, Qumis understands the legal nuance of insurance contracts and benchmarks coverage against real market data, enabling brokers, carriers, and claims teams to interpret, evaluate, and position policies with the precision of experienced coverage counsel and the market context of a seasoned industry insider — at enterprise speed and scale.

### Why this positioning works

- **Category ownership:** "Coverage intelligence" anchors the category, encompassing both legal analysis and market intelligence — a broader, more defensible category definition that competitors can't follow into
- **Credibility anchor:** Attorney-built credentials establish domain authority on the analysis side; the proprietary data asset ("thousands of commercial insurance programs") establishes authority on the market intelligence side — two moats, not one
- **Dual value proposition:** "What a policy says" vs. "what it means in context" captures the full spectrum — from document-level analysis to market-level insight. This is the difference between a reading tool and an intelligence platform
- **Clear contrast:** Separates from three competitors simultaneously: generic AI (no domain expertise), workflow automation (no coverage reasoning), and traditional consulting/law firms (no scale, no market data)
- **Outcome focus:** "Interpret, evaluate, and position" maps to actual jobs-to-be-done across three user personas — claims professionals interpreting coverage, account teams evaluating adequacy, and producers positioning placements
- **Data moat signaling:** Referencing proprietary market data signals this isn't just AI applied to documents — it's accumulated intelligence that gets more valuable over time

## Core Value Propositions

### Legal-Grade Accuracy from Attorney-Trained AI

Qumis doesn't just read policies, it reasons about them. Our AI was developed by a licensed coverage attorney and trained on the interpretive frameworks that experienced counsel use to analyze coverage questions. Every output is citation-linked to source documents, with built-in safeguards that say "I don't know" when evidence is insufficient.

**Proof Points:**

- Founded by a licensed insurance coverage attorney with law firm and in-house experience
- Multi-agent AI architecture mirrors actual legal review processes
- Citation-linked outputs enable audit trails and defensible decisions
- "I don't know" responses prevent AI hallucination on ambiguous coverage questions

> **Tip:** **Messaging rationale:** This is our primary differentiator. Generic AI hallucinates on legal nuance; we're built for legal-grade precision.

### Coverage Intelligence, Not Workflow Automation

Competitors automate document shuffling. Qumis unlocks the intelligence inside the contract itself. We transform unstructured policy language into structured, queryable data that enables coverage reasoning at scale, turning illiquid contract intelligence into a strategic asset.

**Proof Points:**

- Proprietary insurance taxonomies understand clause roles (exclusions, conditions, endorsements)
- Structured data extraction enables programmatic analysis across policy portfolios
- Coverage comparison goes beyond differences to surface strategic implications
- Legal Search (beta) connects policy questions to relevant case law

> **Tip:** **Messaging rationale:** Draws clear contrast with FurtherAI and other workflow tools. We're not faster document processing; we're deeper document understanding.

### Trusted by Enterprise Leaders

Qumis is the platform of choice for the industry's most demanding users. Our enterprise-grade security, SOC 2 certification, and proven scalability have earned the trust of top-tier brokerages navigating their highest-stakes coverage decisions.

**Proof Points:**

- 5 of the top 15 U.S. insurance brokerages using Qumis
- 127% net revenue retention demonstrates expansion within accounts
- SOC 2 Type I certified with enterprise-grade data security
- NFP deployment: expanded from pilot to 250+ seats in production

> **Tip:** **Messaging rationale:** Enterprise logos provide credibility that no feature list can match. This signals we're a proven, enterprise-ready solution.

### Built for How Insurance Actually Works

Insurance professionals don't work in generic workflows. They navigate layered coverage programs, endorsement towers, and nuanced policy language. Qumis was purpose-built for these realities, not adapted from generic document processing tools.

**Proof Points:**

- Document Vault centralizes policy portfolios for cross-document analysis
- Handles complex scenarios: endorsements, amendments, layered programs
- Prompt Library enables team-wide consistency on coverage workflows
- QumisScore provides proprietary accuracy metrics for comparison results

> **Tip:** **Messaging rationale:** Signals deep domain expertise that generic tools can't match.

### Market Intelligence Powered by Proprietary Data

Qumis doesn't just analyze policies in isolation. Our platform draws on a proprietary database of thousands of commercial insurance programs to contextualize every analysis — surfacing how coverage compares to market norms, where gaps exist relative to industry benchmarks, and what best-in-class coverage looks like for a given risk class. This turns every policy review from a standalone reading exercise into a market-informed coverage evaluation.

**Proof Points:**

- Proprietary database of 10,000+ commercial insurance policies across major lines of business
- QumisScore benchmarks coverage quality against market standards
- Coverage gap detection informed by cross-portfolio pattern analysis
- Market context enriches every report, comparison, and coverage opinion

> **Warning:** This content is confidential and for internal use only. Do not share with prospects or external parties.

This section provides messaging frameworks for organizational decision-makers and budget holders. For day-to-day practitioner messaging that drives adoption and internal advocacy, see [Persona-Specific Messaging](/internal/messaging/persona-messaging).

## Brokerage Executives

**Primary concerns:** Competitive differentiation, talent leverage, E\&O risk reduction, client retention, organic growth from existing accounts

**Lead message:** "Qumis gives your team a coverage advantage your competitors can't match — legal-grade insight and market intelligence that wins accounts, retains clients, and scales your best people's expertise across the organization."

**Key talking points:**

- **Talent multiplier:** Senior coverage expertise scales across junior team members — every account manager and producer operates with the analytical depth of your most experienced people
- **Market intelligence advantage:** Your team doesn't just analyze policies — they benchmark coverage against market standards across thousands of commercial programs, giving clients data-backed confidence that their program is competitive
- **Win rate impact:** Data-driven, citation-linked coverage proposals backed by market context beat incumbent guesswork. Your producers walk into meetings with insights the competition can't access
- **E\&O protection:** Citation-linked analysis creates defensible documentation. Every recommendation traces back to source policy language and market benchmarks
- **Client stickiness and organic growth:** Instant, authoritative coverage answers strengthen relationships. Proactive identification of coverage gaps relative to market norms creates natural upsell and cross-sell conversations that drive organic revenue growth

**Proof point to lead with:** "The brokers at NFP reduced complex policy review time by 80% — and expanded from 50 to 250+ active users within months."

### Messaging rationale

Executives care about competitive positioning, revenue growth, and risk reduction — in that order. The lead message avoids dismissing workflow efficiency (which executives are actively buying) and instead positions Qumis as delivering something competitors can't access: legal-grade analysis combined with proprietary market intelligence. The addition of organic growth and cross-sell language connects directly to the revenue expansion story that justifies platform investment.

---

## Claims Leadership

**Primary concerns:** Cycle time, indemnity leakage, consistency of coverage determinations, bad-faith exposure, outside counsel spend

**Lead message:** "Qumis gives your claims organization the coverage reasoning capability of experienced coverage counsel — at the speed and consistency your operation demands. Every adjuster makes better coverage determinations, backed by citation-linked analysis and market intelligence that strengthens your positions."

**Key talking points:**

- **Faster, more accurate determinations:** Coverage analysis that took days now takes hours, with citation-linked reasoning that catches exclusions, endorsements, and coverage defenses that manual review misses under deadline pressure
- **Consistency at scale:** Different adjusters interpreting the same policy language differently creates bad-faith exposure and regulatory risk. Qumis standardizes coverage reasoning across your entire claims organization
- **Reduced outside counsel spend:** Coverage questions that currently get sent to outside counsel at $500–$800/hour can be resolved internally with attorney-grade analysis, reserving outside counsel for genuinely complex disputes
- **Market context for coverage positions:** Contextualize coverage determinations against how similar provisions are structured across thousands of commercial programs — strengthening reservation-of-rights letters and coverage positions with market-informed analysis
- **Defensible documentation:** Citation-backed coverage determinations create audit trails that withstand scrutiny from insureds, regulators, and bad-faith plaintiffs

**Proof point to lead with:** "Built by a licensed insurance coverage attorney who understands exactly how coverage determinations get challenged. Trusted by claims teams at top-tier brokerages and carriers handling complex commercial programs."

### Messaging rationale

Claims leadership buys on accuracy, consistency, and defensibility — not speed alone. The outside counsel spend reduction is a concrete, measurable ROI that finance teams understand. Market intelligence lands here as a credibility enhancer for coverage positions, which is how claims leadership actually thinks about data.

---

## IT & Operations

**Primary concerns:** Security posture, integration complexity, vendor stability, implementation timeline, change management burden

**Lead message:** "Qumis is enterprise-ready from day one — SOC 2 certified, designed for fast deployment, and built to work within your existing technology ecosystem without requiring your team to change how they work."

**Key talking points:**

- **SOC 2 Type I certified:** Enterprise-grade security and compliance, purpose-built for organizations handling sensitive insurance policy and claims data
- **Data isolation and privacy:** Client data is private and never used for AI model training. Meets the data handling standards your most demanding clients require
- **Integration with existing ecosystems:** Designed to work alongside your existing AMS (Applied Epic, Sagitta), document management systems (ImageRight, SharePoint, Box), and email infrastructure (Outlook) — not replace them
- **Minimal IT lift:** Cloud-based deployment with no on-premise infrastructure required. Implementation measured in weeks, not months
- **API-first architecture:** Connects to existing systems and workflows programmatically, enabling custom integrations without disrupting established processes

**Proof point to lead with:** "Trusted by 5 of the top 15 U.S. brokerages, including enterprise-wide deployments at organizations with complex security and compliance requirements."

### Messaging rationale

IT buyers at brokerages have been burned by tools that require ripping out existing infrastructure or creating parallel workflows. The integration language is specific to insurance technology ecosystems (AMS, document management, Outlook) rather than generic SaaS boilerplate — signaling that Qumis understands the actual technology landscape these teams manage. Data isolation language addresses the specific concern insurance IT teams raise about AI tools using their policy data.

This section focuses on the day-to-day practitioners who will use Qumis. Each persona has distinct pain points, priorities, and value drivers that require tailored messaging to drive adoption and internal advocacy. Where [Audience Messaging](/internal/messaging/audience-messaging) addresses why decision-makers should buy Qumis, this section addresses why practitioners will champion and use it.

## Front Office / Producers

**Primary Value Proposition**

Qumis gives you a coverage advantage your competitors don't have. In minutes, you'll deliver legal-grade coverage analysis backed by market intelligence from thousands of commercial programs — presenting data-driven insights that differentiate your proposals and win accounts. While your competitors walk in with generic comparisons, you'll show prospects exactly how their coverage stacks up against the market and where the gaps are, with citations to prove it.

### Key Benefits

- **Market-informed proposals:** Show prospects how their coverage compares not just to their expiring, but to what you're seeing across comparable programs in their industry. That's a fundamentally different conversation than "I reviewed your policy."
- **Competitive differentiation:** Present detailed coverage comparisons that expose gaps in incumbent programs with market context, demonstrating value prospects can't get from any other broker
- **Revenue acceleration:** Close more deals by answering complex coverage questions instantly with citation-linked analysis, keeping prospects engaged instead of waiting days for your team to get back to them
- **Client confidence from day one:** Citation-linked analysis backed by market benchmarks shows you've done deeper homework than anyone else. You're not making claims — you're showing data
- **More selling, less researching:** Focus time on building relationships and closing deals instead of wading through policy documents or waiting on coverage teams to produce analysis

### Pain Points We Solve

- **Inability to demonstrate differentiated value quickly:** Without market data and legal-grade analysis to back up your recommendations, you're just another broker making claims. Prospects need proof, not promises — and your experienced competitors have deep institutional knowledge you need to match
- **Slow sales cycles:** Manual policy reviews create bottlenecks that kill momentum in competitive situations. Prospects go cold waiting for coverage analysis that your coverage team is producing manually
- **Lack of competitive intelligence:** You can't expose gaps in the incumbent program if you can't quickly analyze their current coverage against market standards. Generic comparisons don't win business; market-informed ones do
- **Real-time information gap:** In client meetings, you need instant answers to coverage questions. Saying "I'll get back to you" erodes confidence and gives competitors an opening

### Proof Points

- **80% faster policy reviews:** NFP producers reduced complex policy review time by 80%, freeing time for client-facing activity
- **Market benchmarking:** Coverage comparisons contextualized against thousands of commercial programs across major lines of business
- **Citation-backed proposals:** Every recommendation links directly to policy language — show prospects exactly where coverage gaps exist
- **Built by attorneys:** Developed by a licensed coverage attorney who understands exactly what it takes to evaluate coverage and win business on expertise

### Suggested Talk Tracks

### When competing against workflow platforms

"Those platforms are great for speeding up proposals and data entry — that's table stakes. But when you're sitting across from a prospect and they ask 'How does my coverage compare to what you're seeing in the market?' you need real coverage intelligence, not just faster document processing. Qumis gives you the answer that wins the business — legal-grade analysis backed by market data from thousands of commercial programs, with citations you can show them on the spot. That's the competitive advantage that matters."

### Cold open for producer conversations

"I know your time is valuable, and you need to walk into prospect meetings with something your competitors can't match. Qumis gives you instant, legal-grade analysis on any policy — I can show you coverage gaps and market benchmarking backed by actual policy language, right here in our meeting. You'll show prospects how their program stacks up against comparable accounts in their industry. Let me pull up a program and show you what I mean."

---

## Back Office / Account Managers

**Primary Value Proposition**

Qumis makes you the most knowledgeable person on your client's coverage program. Instead of spending your days extracting data from policy documents, you'll have structured intelligence at your fingertips — with the market context to proactively identify coverage gaps, flag renewal risks, and provide the kind of strategic guidance that makes clients see you as an indispensable partner, not a service coordinator.

### Key Benefits

- **Proactive client advisor:** Surface coverage gaps and market insights at renewal — "Based on what we're seeing across comparable programs, here are three areas where your client's coverage has fallen behind market standard." That's strategic account management, not just policy processing
- **Confidence on every client call:** Citation-linked analysis means you never have to guess or hedge on a coverage question. When a client calls about a specific exclusion, you have the answer — backed by source policy language
- **Operational efficiency:** Slash the time spent on policy reviews, coverage summaries, and renewal preparation from hours to minutes per task. Structured data extraction eliminates manual copy-paste and the typos that come with it
- **Error reduction:** Citation-linked outputs eliminate the risk of missing critical exclusions or misreading endorsements — no more corrections to clients, no more E\&O anxiety
- **Handle renewals without the panic:** Manage growing books of business without working weekends or the 2 AM realization that you missed something in a 200-page program

### Pain Points We Solve

- **Reactive instead of strategic:** You spend your days responding to urgent requests instead of proactively strengthening client relationships. You know you should be surfacing renewal insights and coverage recommendations, but there's never enough time
- **Manual data extraction burden:** Hours spent pulling policy details, limits, deductibles, and endorsements from PDFs into summaries and spreadsheets — tedious work that's also the most error-prone part of your job
- **No market context for renewals:** You can tell a client what their policy says, but you can't tell them how it compares to what similar organizations are buying. That market insight is what separates strategic advisors from service teams
- **Coverage questions that stump you:** When a client asks about a specific endorsement interaction or whether an exclusion applies to their situation, you either guess, escalate, or say "I'll get back to you." All three erode confidence
- **Firefighting vs. strategic work:** Your days are consumed by the urgent instead of the important. Every hour you spend on manual policy extraction is an hour you're not spending on the client relationship work that actually drives retention

### Proof Points

- **Structured data extraction:** Qumis automatically pulls policy details into organized, searchable formats — no more copy-paste or typos
- **Market intelligence:** Benchmark client coverage against comparable programs to proactively identify gaps and strengthen renewal conversations
- **Document Vault:** Centralized repository for all client policies — instant access for the entire team, no more hunting through shared drives
- **Prompt Library:** Team-wide consistency on coverage workflows — everyone delivers the same quality, reducing training burden
- **User testimonial:** "It made our policy reviews faster, sharper, and more accurate while eliminating the need for an additional hire — it's a no-brainer." — Senior account manager at a top-15 brokerage

> **Info:** **Integration note:** Qumis is designed to work within the tools you already use — integrating with your email workflow through Outlook and connecting to document management systems like SharePoint and Box. You don't need to change how you work; Qumis fits into your existing process.

### Suggested Talk Tracks

### When competing against workflow platforms

"Workflow platforms are excellent for proposal generation and AMS data entry — they save you hours on admin work. But when a client calls asking about a specific exclusion, or why their claim might not be covered, or how their coverage compares to the market, you need more than automated data extraction. You need to actually understand the policy and its context. Qumis gives you the coverage intelligence to answer confidently, with citations you can share and market benchmarks to back you up."

### Cold open for AM conversations

"I know you're juggling dozens of accounts and every policy request feels urgent. What if you could walk into your next renewal meeting not just with the policy analysis, but with market insights showing how your client's coverage stacks up against comparable programs? Qumis handles the heavy lifting — extracting data, identifying gaps, benchmarking against the market — so you can focus on the strategic conversations that keep clients loyal. Let me show you what a renewal prep looks like with Qumis."

## Claims Professionals

**Primary Value Proposition**

Qumis accelerates claims resolution while strengthening your coverage position. When a claim arrives, you'll instantly understand the applicable coverage, identify relevant exclusions and endorsements, and build defensible positions backed by citation-linked analysis and market intelligence. Instead of days spent manually reviewing policies and researching coverage questions, you'll deliver faster, more confident determinations with documentation that holds up under scrutiny.

### Key Benefits

- **Faster cycle times:** Coverage analysis that took days now takes hours — accelerating claims resolution and getting to the right answer before deadline pressure forces a rushed decision
- **Improved accuracy:** Citation-linked analysis ensures you never miss a critical exclusion or misinterpret an endorsement during coverage determination. Every relevant provision is surfaced, not just the ones you happened to find
- **Market-informed coverage positions:** Contextualize your coverage determinations against how similar provisions are structured across thousands of commercial programs — strengthening reservation-of-rights letters and coverage positions with market data, not just policy language
- **Defensible documentation:** Citation-backed coverage determinations create audit trails that withstand scrutiny from insureds, regulators, and bad-faith plaintiffs. Your reasoning is documented, sourced, and replicable
- **Identify coverage defenses comprehensively:** Surface every applicable exclusion, limitation, and condition — including the ones that get overlooked under deadline pressure — to build the strongest defensible position on every file

### Pain Points We Solve

- **Manual policy review bottlenecks:** Each claim requires hours of reading through policies, endorsements, and exclusions before you can make coverage determinations — and the more complex the program, the more likely something gets missed
- **Inconsistent handling across the team:** Different adjusters interpret the same policy language differently, creating exposure to bad-faith claims and regulatory scrutiny. There's no standardized approach to coverage reasoning
- **Missed coverage defenses under pressure:** Under deadline pressure, it's easy to overlook a relevant exclusion or limitation that could have reduced or eliminated indemnity exposure. You find out when the file gets reviewed — or worse, in litigation
- **No market context for coverage positions:** You know what the policy says, but you don't know how the provision compares to standard market language. That context strengthens your position — or tells you when a coverage argument is on shaky ground
- **Outside counsel dependency:** Complex coverage questions get sent to outside counsel at $500–$800/hour when they could be resolved internally with the right analytical tools. Every referral is a budget line item and a cycle time delay

### Proof Points

- **Attorney-trained AI:** Built by a licensed coverage attorney who understands exactly how coverage determinations get challenged — and what it takes to build positions that hold up
- **Complex coverage analysis in hours, not days:** Instant access to all relevant policy provisions, exclusions, and endorsements for any claim scenario
- **Market intelligence:** Benchmark policy provisions against comparable programs to understand whether your coverage position is on solid or contested ground
- **User testimonial:** "After using it on layered programs and seeing it find discrepancies I missed, I was sold." — Claims professional at a top-15 brokerage

> **Info:** **Claims personas note:** Claims professionals sit on both sides of the table — carrier-side adjusters making coverage determinations and broker-side claims advocates arguing for coverage on behalf of their clients. Tailor the messaging accordingly:
>
> - **Carrier-side adjusters:** Emphasize accuracy, defensibility, consistency, and loss ratio impact. They need to make the right call and document it.
> - **Broker-side claims advocates:** Emphasize finding every basis for coverage, building the strongest position for the insured, and reducing reliance on outside counsel. They need to argue persuasively.
>
> Both benefit from the same underlying capability — legal-grade coverage reasoning — but the framing should reflect their opposing objectives.

> **Info:** **Integration note:** Qumis works alongside your existing claims management system and email workflow. Coverage analysis can be initiated directly from your inbox and results integrated into your existing documentation process — no new system to learn, no disruption to your current workflow.

### Suggested Talk Tracks

### When competing against workflow platforms

"Workflow platforms excel at claims intake and data extraction — routing files and pulling information from forms. That's valuable for volume. But when you need to make an actual coverage determination — whether an exclusion applies, how endorsements interact, what your exposure is — that requires legal-grade policy reasoning, not document processing. Qumis was built by a coverage attorney specifically for these decisions. Many claims teams use workflow tools for intake and Qumis for the actual coverage analysis."

### Cold open for claims conversations

"When a complex claim comes in, every hour matters — for the insured and for your exposure. Qumis instantly analyzes the policy and surfaces every relevant coverage provision, exclusion, and endorsement, then lets you benchmark those provisions against market standards. You get citation-backed coverage determinations in hours instead of days, with the documentation to defend your position. Let me show you how it works on a complex program."

# Competitive Differentiation

Source: internal/messaging/competitive-differentiation

> **Warning:** This content is confidential and for internal use only. Do not share with prospects or external parties.

The market for AI in commercial insurance is splitting into two categories: tools that automate insurance workflows and platforms that deliver coverage intelligence. Most vendors — regardless of funding or positioning — fall into the first category: they make existing processes faster without fundamentally changing the quality of coverage analysis. Qumis created and owns the second category. Our competitive frame must reinforce this distinction at every turn.

## The Competitive Landscape

Qumis encounters four competitive alternatives in sales conversations, each requiring a distinct positioning approach:

1. **Workflow automation platforms** (FurtherAI, Fulcrum) — the most frequent head-to-head competitor
2. **Generic AI tools** (ChatGPT, Copilot, internal builds) — the most frequent budget objection
3. **In-house coverage experts and outside counsel** — the incumbent solution for complex coverage questions
4. **Status quo** (manual processes) — the "do nothing" alternative

---

## vs. Workflow Automation Platforms (FurtherAI, Fulcrum)

| They Say | We Say |
| :---- | :---- |
| "Automate your insurance workflows" | "Understand your coverage at a legal level — and benchmark it against the market" |
| Faster document processing | Deeper document understanding + market intelligence |
| Generic LLM with insurance UI | Purpose-built coverage reasoning engine trained by a licensed attorney |
| Speed and efficiency metrics | Accuracy, insight quality, and defensibility metrics |
| "Eliminate busywork" | "Elevate the quality of every coverage decision" |
| No proprietary data asset | Proprietary database of thousands of commercial programs |

**Competitive Talking Points:**

FurtherAI (a16z-backed) and Fulcrum both raised large rounds in late 2025 competing on workflow automation. We compete on a fundamentally different dimension: legal-grade coverage intelligence that understands what policies actually mean and benchmarks them against real market data. They make document processing faster. We make coverage decisions better.

Workflow platforms excel at submissions intake, data entry, and proposal generation — moving information between systems. Qumis excels at coverage reasoning — understanding policy language, identifying coverage gaps, explaining legal implications, and contextualizing coverage against market standards. Different problems, different solutions. Many of our customers use both: workflow tools for operational speed, Qumis for analytical depth. We are the intelligence layer that makes the entire technology stack smarter.

> **Tip:** **The complementary positioning is strategic, not defensive.** Positioning Qumis alongside workflow tools rather than against them accomplishes three things: it neutralizes the "we already have FurtherAI" objection, it expands the budget conversation (different line item, different value), and it positions Qumis as the higher-value platform in the stack.

### Killer Questions to Expose the Gap

- "Can your AI explain why a pollution exclusion applies differently under occurrence vs. claims-made policies?" — Exposes the legal reasoning gap
- "Can their platform tell you how that exclusion compares to what carriers are writing across comparable programs in your industry?" — Exposes the market intelligence gap. No workflow tool can answer this
- "When your AI identifies a coverage gap, does it cite the specific policy language and explain the legal basis for the conclusion — or just flag a difference?" — Exposes the citation and defensibility gap
- "Who on their founding team is a licensed coverage attorney?" — Exposes the domain expertise gap. Most effective with senior coverage professionals who understand what legal training means for policy interpretation

### Competitor-Specific Notes

> **Warning:** **Internal use only — do not share with prospects.**

- **FurtherAI:** Positions as "AI Workspace for Insurance" with workflow focus on submissions, audits, and claims intake. Founded by ML engineers. Strong on engineering talent and automation speed. Weak on coverage reasoning depth, legal defensibility, and market intelligence. They are building for operations teams; we are building for coverage professionals
- **Fulcrum:** Positions as "Scale your accounts, not your headcount" with full lifecycle automation including AMS integration, proposals, and policy checking. Strong on breadth of workflow coverage. Weak on analytical depth — their "policy checking" is surface-level compliance, not legal-grade coverage analysis with market context

---

## vs. Generic AI (ChatGPT, etc.)

This is the most common objection your sales team will encounter. It takes three forms, each requiring a different response:

### Form 1: "Why can't we just use ChatGPT?" (The casual dismissal)

**Response framework:** Generic AI hallucinates on insurance questions because it has no domain-specific training, no insurance taxonomies, and no safeguards for when evidence is insufficient. It treats exclusions and conditions identically. It can't cite specific policy language. And it has zero proprietary market data to contextualize its output. Qumis was built by a licensed coverage attorney who encoded legal reasoning frameworks into the platform, backed by a proprietary database of thousands of commercial programs. The gap isn't small — it's structural.

### Form 2: "Our IT team can build something with the API." (The build-vs-buy objection)

**Response framework:** Building a policy analysis tool on top of GPT is straightforward. Building one that delivers legal-grade accuracy with citation-linked outputs, multi-agent validation, insurance-specific taxonomies, and proprietary market benchmarking is a multi-year, multi-million-dollar effort that requires deep insurance domain expertise your IT team doesn't have. Every month you spend building, your competitors are already using Qumis. And you'll never replicate the proprietary data asset — that requires thousands of real commercial programs analyzed over years.

### Form 3: "AI is improving fast — won't this be commoditized?" (The wait-and-see objection)

**Response framework:** Foundation models are improving rapidly — which makes the generic layer more commoditized, not less. What becomes more valuable as generic AI improves is the domain-specific intelligence layer: the legal reasoning frameworks, the insurance taxonomies, the proprietary market data, and the accumulated understanding of how policy language gets interpreted in practice. That's what Qumis is. We ride the improvement curve of foundation models while maintaining the domain expertise and data moat that generic tools can never replicate. The gap doesn't close over time — it widens.

### Key Differentiators (All Forms)

- **Citation-linked outputs:** Every conclusion traces to source policy language. Generic AI provides answers without evidence
- **"I don't know" safeguards:** When evidence is insufficient, Qumis says so. Generic AI confidently hallucinates — which in insurance creates E\&O exposure
- **Insurance taxonomies:** Qumis understands the structural roles of policy provisions (exclusions, conditions, endorsements, definitions). Generic AI treats them as undifferentiated text
- **Proprietary market data:** Qumis benchmarks coverage against thousands of real commercial programs. Generic AI has no proprietary insurance data whatsoever
- **Audit trail:** Qumis creates traceable, defensible documentation suitable for regulatory and litigation scrutiny. Generic AI outputs are ephemeral and untraceable

**Soundbite:** "You wouldn't use ChatGPT for a legal opinion. Why would you trust it with legal contracts worth millions in coverage?"

---

## vs. Outside Counsel & Coverage Consultants

This competitor is often invisible in the sales process because it's not a software vendor — it's the law firm or coverage consultant the organization already uses for complex coverage questions. But it's the incumbent solution for exactly the use case where Qumis is strongest.

**The Frame:** Qumis doesn't replace outside counsel on genuinely complex disputes or litigation matters. But for the vast majority of coverage questions — the ones that currently generate a $5,000–$10,000 outside counsel invoice and a 2–3 week turnaround — Qumis delivers attorney-grade analysis in hours at a fraction of the cost. Reserve outside counsel for the matters that truly require it. Use Qumis for everything else.

**Key Talking Points:**

- **Economics:** Outside counsel bills $500–$800/hour for coverage analysis. A typical coverage opinion costs $5,000–$10,000 and takes 2–3 weeks. Qumis delivers comparable analysis in hours at a fraction of the cost
- **Speed:** When a claim comes in or a renewal deadline approaches, waiting weeks for outside counsel isn't viable. Qumis provides immediate coverage reasoning that enables faster decisions
- **Built by one of them:** Qumis was built by a licensed insurance coverage attorney who practiced coverage law. The analytical frameworks in the platform are the same ones coverage counsel use — encoded in software that operates at enterprise speed
- **Scale:** Outside counsel doesn't scale. You can't send every coverage question to a law firm. Qumis makes legal-grade analysis available for every policy, every claim, every renewal — not just the ones with enough dollars at stake to justify an outside counsel engagement
- **Complementary, not replacement:** For matters heading to litigation or requiring formal legal opinions, outside counsel remains essential. Qumis handles the 80% of coverage questions that don't require a formal engagement — and provides better-prepared analysis for the 20% that do

**Soundbite:** "Your outside counsel charges $500/hour and takes three weeks. Qumis delivers the same analytical rigor in hours. Save outside counsel for the matters that truly need it."

## vs. Status Quo (Manual Processes)

For prospects not yet evaluating AI solutions, the competitor is their current manual process — experienced professionals reading policies, comparing documents side by side, and relying on institutional knowledge.

**The Frame:** Manual coverage analysis works until it doesn't. It's slow, inconsistent across team members, and doesn't scale. Your best coverage people are bottlenecks, and when they leave, their expertise walks out the door. Qumis doesn't replace human judgment — it amplifies it, ensuring every team member operates with the same analytical depth and market context as your most experienced people.

**Key Talking Points:**

- **Consistency:** Manual processes produce different answers from different people on the same policy. Qumis standardizes coverage reasoning without eliminating human judgment
- **Institutional knowledge risk:** Your best coverage people's expertise lives in their heads. Qumis captures and scales that analytical capability across the organization
- **Scale:** Your team can't manually analyze every policy with the same rigor. Some get thorough reviews; others get skimmed. Qumis makes thorough analysis the default, not the exception
- **Market context:** Even your most experienced people can only draw on the programs they've personally seen. Qumis benchmarks against thousands of commercial programs — broader market visibility than any individual can accumulate in a career

**Soundbite:** "Your best coverage person has seen maybe a thousand programs in their career. Qumis has analyzed thousands — and brings that market context to every analysis, for every member of your team."

## Competitive Positioning Summary

| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Counter | Our Unassailable Advantage |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Workflow Platforms | Operational speed, breadth of automation | We're complementary, not competitive — different value, different budget | Legal reasoning + proprietary market data. They can't build this. |
| Generic AI | Low cost, general capability, improving rapidly | Domain expertise, citation architecture, "I don't know" safeguards | Proprietary insurance data and attorney-trained reasoning. The gap widens as generic AI commoditizes. |
| Outside Counsel | Deep expertise, legal defensibility, litigation authority | Same analytical rigor at 10% of the cost and 10x the speed | Scale and speed. Law firms can't serve every coverage question economically. |
| Status Quo | Trusted, proven, no implementation risk | Amplifies human judgment, doesn't replace it; scales expertise across the team | Market intelligence from thousands of programs — broader than any individual's experience. |

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Never disparage competitors by name to prospects.** Reference them by category ("workflow automation tools") unless the prospect brings up a specific vendor
2. **Lead with the complementary frame** for workflow platforms. "We work alongside them" is stronger than "we're better than them" — it neutralizes the objection and elevates your positioning
3. **Use killer questions sparingly and strategically.** They're most effective when a prospect is actively comparing you to a specific competitor, not as an opening move
4. **Always bring it back to market intelligence.** This is the differentiator that ends competitive conversations. No competitor — workflow platform, generic AI, or law firm — has a proprietary database of thousands of commercial insurance programs. When in doubt, land here
5. **Competitor funding is internal context only.** Do not reference competitor funding amounts to prospects — it invites unfavorable comparisons. Your sales team should know the landscape; your prospects should hear about your value

## Customer Testimonials

### Coverage Expertise & Accuracy

**Tom Hanekamp** — Senior Partner, Cruser Mitchell (Coverage Counsel)

> "I tested it with real-world coverage disputes, and it consistently delivered thoughtful, well-reasoned responses."

*Context: Uses Qumis daily for coverage opinions. Also originated the "first-year associate" comparison and tested Qumis against ChatGPT on a racial discrimination exclusion analysis — Qumis got the coverage position correct where ChatGPT failed.*
*Best for: Claims messaging, competitive differentiation vs. generic AI, credibility with coverage professionals*

**Connor Love** — National Director of Growth, IMA Financial

> "At first, I thought, 'There's no way this will catch everything.' But after using it on layered programs and seeing it track discrepancies I might have missed, I was sold."

*Context: 300+ policies analyzed in first 90 days at IMA.*
*Best for: Producer/front office messaging, skeptic conversion, layered program complexity proof point*

### Operational Efficiency & ROI

**Brian Pilarski** — SVP & Partner, Kapnick

> "Qumis makes our policy reviews faster, sharper, and more accurate — it's a no-brainer. We cut our policy review time in half and eliminated the need for an additional hire."

*Context: Team of 20 using Qumis since Q1 2025. Kapnick has the highest per-user engagement of any Qumis account (718 average engagement score).*
*Best for: Account manager messaging, brokerage executive ROI conversations, headcount/efficiency proof point*

**Brandon M.** — Senior Claims Advocate, Top 5 Broker (anonymized)

> "Without Qumis, my caseload would be overwhelming. This isn't about working faster — it changed what's possible in my job."

*Context: Source of the 8x faster, +33% capacity, and $1.8M recovery metrics.*
*Best for: Claims messaging, capacity/scale proof point, "not just faster — fundamentally different" positioning*

### Trust & Reliability

**Vance Woods** — Senior Claims Adjuster, Skyward Specialty

> "What I would normally have to spend a couple hours on, I can condense into 30 minutes or less. It helps narrow down and logically note the file in terms of how you arrive at a decision or conclusion. The consistency's there — it's stable."

*Context: Inland marine/cargo claims specialist. Saved $21,000 on a single claim when Qumis identified a reefer exclusion buried in a 1,000-page policy that he had missed. The Vance story is one of the most compelling claims narratives — he was already negotiating a settlement at 70 cents on the dollar before Qumis caught the exclusion.*
*Best for: Claims messaging, accuracy/defensibility proof point, the "what you're missing" argument*

**Joanne Snow** — Senior Claims Technical Director, Skyward Specialty (D\&O/Management Liability)

> "I use it as a checklist to make sure I'm looking at everything I need to. It gives you a second pair of eyes — it confirms what you're thinking, or flags areas you need to look at. For these D\&O claims with so many nuances, I think it's helpful for that."

*Context: Experienced claims professional who positions Qumis as a validation tool, not a replacement. This framing is critical for credibility with senior coverage professionals who are skeptical of AI doing their job.*
*Best for: Claims messaging to senior/skeptical practitioners, "second pair of eyes" positioning, D\&O/specialty lines proof point*

**Daniel Berkowitz** — Partner, Cruser Mitchell (Coverage Counsel)

Value articulation: "$150/month vs. associate salary"

*Context: Confirmed the first-year associate comparison with Hanekamp. The $150/month vs. first-year associate salary framing is a powerful ROI anchor for coverage counsel conversations.*
*Best for: Outside counsel ROI comparison, law firm sales conversations*

## Credibility Markers

### Founding Team

1. **Dan Schuleman, Esq.** — Co-Founder & CEO. Licensed insurance coverage attorney with law firm and in-house experience. This is the single most important credibility marker in the entire company — it backs the "attorney-trained AI" claim with a real person, not a marketing phrase
2. **Shiv Sinha** — Co-Founder & CTO. Former Head of Application Development at Goldman Sachs; led development of Marcus, Goldman's consumer banking platform. Establishes technical credibility at enterprise scale

> **Tip:** The attorney + enterprise tech founder combination is rare and should be referenced frequently. "Founded by a coverage attorney and the former head of application development at Goldman Sachs" is a one-sentence credibility anchor.

### Institutional Validation

1. **SOC 2 Type I certified** — enterprise-grade security and compliance
2. **$6.5M total funding** — $2.2M pre-seed; $4.3M oversubscribed seed round led by MTech Capital with American Family Ventures as new strategic investor and participation from all prior investors
3. **Selected for FinTech Innovation Lab New York** — top 3% of applicants. The program is run by the Partnership Fund for New York City and Accenture, with mentorship from senior executives at leading financial institutions
4. **Oversubscribed pre-seed and seed rounds** — demand exceeded allocation, signaling strong investor conviction

> **Info:** **Funding narrative:** MTech Capital is an insurtech-focused fund; American Family Ventures is the venture arm of American Family Insurance, one of the largest P\&C insurers in the US. The combination of specialist insurtech investors and strategic P\&C capital validates both the technology thesis and the market opportunity.

### Product & Technology

1. **Proprietary database of 10,000+ commercial insurance policies** across major lines of business — this is the data moat that competitors cannot replicate
2. **Multi-agent AI architecture** — specialized AI agents read, validate, and cross-reference documents, mirroring actual legal review processes
3. **Citation-linked outputs** — every conclusion traces to source policy language, creating auditable, defensible analysis
4. **"I don't know" safeguards** — the platform explicitly flags insufficient evidence rather than hallucinating, a critical trust differentiator in a profession where overconfident wrong answers create liability
5. **QumisScore** — proprietary coverage quality scoring that benchmarks policies against market standards

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: "The $21,000 Exclusion" — Vance Woods, Skyward Specialty

**Situation:** A cargo claim comes in. The insured's broker is calling every other day pushing for resolution. Vance's initial assessment: the claim is covered. He begins negotiating a settlement at 70 cents on the dollar.

**What he missed:** Buried in a 1,000-page policy was a reefer exclusion. The claim was based on temperature malfunction of the refrigeration unit — squarely within the exclusion. No coverage. But manually clicking through 1,000 pages under deadline pressure? He didn't catch it.

**What Qumis found:** When Vance ran the policy through Qumis, it identified the exclusion immediately. He generated a position letter citing the exact policy language. The broker's own investigation confirmed no coverage. Claim denied. File closed. $21,000 saved on a single claim.

> "The worst thing is a call from underwriting saying, 'Did you not see that exclusion?' After a while, the company will tell you to take your equipment and go."

*Best for: Claims sales conversations, live demo narrative, conference presentations. This story is visceral — it's about job security, not just efficiency.*

### Case Study 2: "The Capacity Transformation" — Brandon M., Top 5 Regional Broker

**Situation:** Senior claims advocate managing hundreds of active claims across complex verticals at a top-5 US brokerage. Caseload is at capacity. Adding staff would take months and $150K+ in salary.

**Impact with Qumis:**

1. Policy review time: 8x faster (hours to 5–10 minutes)
2. Claims response time: 7x faster (~1 week to same/next day)
3. Claims capacity: +33% (150 to 200 claims/month)
4. Additional claim recovery: $1.8M in a single month
5. Headcount impact: Eliminated need for additional hire

> "Without Qumis, my caseload would be overwhelming. This isn't about working faster — it changed what's possible in my job."

*Best for: Claims leadership ROI conversations, board presentations, investor deck. The $1.8M recovery number is the single most powerful ROI data point in the entire Qumis story.*

### Case Study 3: "Land and Expand" — NFP

**Situation:** NFP, a top-15 US brokerage, began with a 50-seat pilot in Q2 2025 focused on the middle-market team.

**Expansion trajectory:** Within months, the deployment expanded to 250+ production users and extended into NFP's construction practice group in Q4 2025. This represents the land-and-expand motion that drives 127% NRR.

**What this proves:** Enterprise insurance organizations don't just try Qumis — they deploy it broadly once they see results. The expansion from middle-market to construction practice demonstrates cross-practice-group utility and internal champion advocacy.

*Best for: Brokerage executive conversations ("this is what adoption looks like at organizations your size"), investor deck, competitive positioning.*

# Language Guide

Source: internal/messaging/language-guide

> **Warning:** This content is confidential and for internal use only. Do not share with prospects or external parties.

This section governs how Qumis talks about itself — in marketing copy, sales conversations, investor materials, customer communications, and internal documents. Language discipline is what turns positioning into brand. If a term isn't here, think twice before using it. If a term is in the "Avoid" list, don't use it regardless of context.

## Core Vocabulary: Terms to Use

| Term | Why It Works | Primary Context |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Coverage intelligence** | Category-defining. Positions Qumis above "automation" and "document processing." This is the term that should appear in every headline, every first paragraph, every elevator pitch. | All contexts — this is the category name |
| **Legal-grade** | Signals precision and defensibility without claiming to be legal advice. The hyphen matters — it's a compound modifier, not a noun. Always "legal-grade analysis," never "legal analysis." | Marketing, sales, investor materials |
| **Attorney-trained AI** | Credibility anchor. Differentiates from generic AI and workflow tools. Implies a specific person (Dan) built the reasoning frameworks, not just that lawyers were "consulted." | Marketing headlines, competitive positioning, first-meeting sales conversations |
| **Citation-linked** | Demonstrates accountability. Directly addresses the hallucination concern that every informed buyer has. More specific and credible than "accurate" or "reliable." | Product descriptions, competitive differentiation vs. generic AI, IT/compliance conversations |
| **Coverage reasoning** | Conveys analytical depth — Qumis doesn't just find text, it interprets meaning. Distinguishes from search/retrieval tools. | Product descriptions, technical conversations, persona messaging for coverage professionals |
| **Market intelligence** | Signals the proprietary data asset — Qumis doesn't just analyze a single policy, it contextualizes coverage against thousands of real commercial programs. This is the term that ends competitive conversations. | Sales conversations (especially later-stage), competitive differentiation, investor materials |
| **Proprietary data / Proprietary database** | Establishes the data moat. "Proprietary" signals that this asset cannot be replicated by competitors. Always pair with scale: "proprietary database of thousands of commercial insurance programs." | Competitive differentiation, investor materials, enterprise sales |
| **Coverage benchmarking** | Translates the data moat into a buyer benefit. Practitioners understand benchmarking — it's how they already think about market positioning. | Producer messaging, account manager messaging, executive conversations |
| **Enterprise-grade** | Signals security, scale, and seriousness. Use in IT/operations contexts. | IT buyer conversations, security documentation, RFP responses |
| **Built by experts, for experts** | Establishes peer credibility with practitioners who are skeptical of "tech people" building insurance tools. | Marketing, first-meeting positioning, conference presentations |
| **Coverage intelligence platform** | The full product descriptor. Use when you need to name what Qumis is (not just what it does). Replaces "AI platform for insurance" or "policy analysis tool." | Website, press releases, formal descriptions |
| **Insurance-native** | Signals that Qumis was built specifically for insurance from the ground up — not a generic AI tool with an insurance skin. | Competitive differentiation, product descriptions |
| **QumisScore** | Proprietary coverage quality scoring. Use when discussing the market intelligence capability specifically. Treat as a proper noun (capitalized, one word). | Product demos, account manager messaging, expansion conversations |

## Terms to Avoid

| Avoid | Why | Say Instead |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "AI-powered" (alone) | Generic. Every company says this. It communicates nothing about what makes Qumis different. | "Attorney-trained AI" or "insurance-native AI" |
| "Game-changer" | Marketing-speak. Let customers say it — and they do (see testimonials). When Qumis says it, it undermines credibility with skeptical insurance buyers. | Let the proof points speak. Or: "fundamentally different approach" |
| "Automate" / "Automation" (as primary descriptor) | Cedes positioning to workflow tools. If Qumis is "automation," buyers compare you to FurtherAI and Fulcrum on their terms. | "Intelligence" or "analysis" as lead terms. Exception: acceptable to say "Qumis adds intelligence to your existing automation" in the complementary frame — but Qumis itself is never the automation |
| "GPT" / "ChatGPT" (in Qumis descriptions) | Anchors to generic AI and invites direct comparison. Only reference ChatGPT in competitive differentiation contexts, never in Qumis product descriptions. | "Purpose-built AI" or "coverage reasoning engine" |
| "Revolutionary" / "Disruptive" | Oversold. Insurance buyers have heard this from every vendor for 20 years. These words signal "startup that doesn't understand our industry." | Show, don't tell. Let the metrics and testimonials make the case. |
| "Effortless" / "Seamless" | Undermines the expertise of your users. Coverage analysis is serious, consequential work. Calling it "effortless" disrespects the profession. | "Faster" or "more efficient" — acknowledge the work while showing how Qumis elevates it |
| "Copilot" (unqualified) | Overused across every AI product. Diluted to meaninglessness. | If used at all, always qualify: "coverage copilot." But prefer "coverage intelligence platform." |
| "Solution" | Empty corporate-speak. A "solution" could be anything. | Be specific: "platform," "analysis," "intelligence," or name the actual capability |
| "Leverage" / "Utilize" | Corporate jargon that makes copy feel generic. | "Use," "apply," "deploy" — plain language is more credible with practitioners |
| "End-to-end" | Implies workflow automation breadth, which is the competitor's positioning. Qumis wins on depth, not breadth. | Describe the specific capability: "from initial analysis through defensible documentation" |
| "Policy analysis tool" | Undersells the platform. A "tool" is commoditized; a "platform" is infrastructure. "Analysis" alone misses the market intelligence dimension. | "Coverage intelligence platform" |

---

## Key Phrases by Context

### Strategic Positioning Phrases

*Use in marketing, investor materials, executive conversations*

**"Understanding the policy is the hardest problem in insurance."** — This is the single most important strategic phrase in Qumis's vocabulary. It reframes the entire market conversation from workflow speed to analytical depth. Use it to open conversations, presentations, and anchor competitive discussions. When a buyer agrees with this statement, they've already self-selected into Qumis's value proposition.

**"Coverage intelligence, not workflow automation."** — The category distinction in six words. Use when positioning against competitors or when a buyer tries to lump Qumis with workflow tools.

**"Law-firm accuracy at enterprise scale."** — Concise, memorable, captures both the legal expertise and the scalability. Strong headline language.

**"We deliver not just what a policy says, but what it means in the context of the broader market."** — The dual value proposition in one sentence. Use when explaining the positioning to someone for the first time.

### Sales Conversation Phrases

*Use in demos, discovery calls, follow-up emails*

**"Like having a coverage attorney on every account."** — The evolved version of the first-year associate comparison. Works for brokerage executives and anyone who understands the cost of outside counsel. Implies scale (every account) and quality (attorney-level).

**"Like having a first-year associate — only faster and more accurate."** — Tom Hanekamp's original framing. Most effective with claims professionals, coverage counsel, and anyone who has managed junior staff. Use when the audience has legal context.

**"Your most experienced person has seen maybe a thousand programs in their career. Qumis has analyzed thousands — and brings that market context to every analysis."** — The market intelligence proof point. Use when differentiating against the status quo or when a buyer says "our people are good enough."

**"Qumis is the intelligence layer that makes your entire technology stack smarter."** — The complementary positioning frame. Use when the buyer already has FurtherAI, Fulcrum, or another workflow tool and you need to position alongside rather than against.

**"We built the 'I don't know' into the system on purpose."** — Use when addressing hallucination concerns. This flips a perceived AI weakness into a trust differentiator. Particularly effective with compliance-oriented buyers and IT decision-makers.

### Competitive Phrases

*Use when directly compared to alternatives*

**"You wouldn't use ChatGPT for a legal opinion. Why would you trust it with legal contracts worth millions in coverage?"** — The generic AI soundbite. Strong opener, but be prepared for the follow-up objection: "We're not using it for legal opinions, just for faster document review." Response: "That's exactly the risk — when a tool doesn't know the difference between document review and coverage analysis, it can't tell you when the answer matters."

**"Can their platform tell you how that exclusion compares to what carriers are writing across comparable programs?"** — The killer question that exposes the market intelligence gap. No workflow tool or generic AI can answer this.

**"Who on their founding team is a licensed coverage attorney?"** — The credibility question. Most effective with senior coverage professionals. Use sparingly and strategically — it's a knockout punch, not a jab.

**"Different problems, different solutions. Many of our customers use both."** — The complementary frame for workflow competitors. Neutralizes the "we already have X" objection.

### Customer Success Phrases

*Use in onboarding, QBRs, renewal conversations*

**"The goal isn't to replace your judgment — it's to make sure every member of your team operates with the same analytical depth as your best people."** — The amplification frame for expansion conversations.

**"How many coverage questions does your team handle that currently don't get a thorough analysis because there isn't enough time?"** — The unmet demand question. Reveals the addressable opportunity within the account and supports expansion.

### Competitor Reference Language

When referring to competitors in any context, use these category terms consistently:

| Competitor | How to Reference (External) | How to Reference (Internal) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| FurtherAI | "Workflow automation tools" | FurtherAI (by name, internal only) |
| Fulcrum | "Workflow automation platforms" | Fulcrum (by name, internal only) |
| ChatGPT / Copilot | "Generic AI" or "general-purpose AI" | ChatGPT, Copilot (by name) |
| Internal builds | "Custom-built solutions" | "Build vs. buy" frame |
| Outside counsel | "Outside counsel" or "coverage consultants" | Same |
| Manual processes | "Current manual process" or "status quo" | Same |

> **Warning:** **Rule:** Never reference a competitor by name to a prospect unless the prospect brings them up first. Always refer by category. If the prospect names a specific competitor, you may respond using the competitor's name — but redirect to category framing as quickly as possible.

---

## Regulatory & Legal Guardrails

"Legal-grade" is Qumis's most powerful term. It is also the term most likely to create liability if misused. These guardrails are non-negotiable:

- **Qumis does not provide legal advice.** "Legal-grade" refers to the quality, rigor, and methodology of the analysis — not to the legal authority of the output. Every external-facing description of Qumis should be reviewed to ensure it does not imply that Qumis output constitutes a legal opinion
- **"Attorney-trained" means the platform's reasoning frameworks were built by a licensed coverage attorney.** It does not mean every output has been reviewed by an attorney
- **All marketing copy, website pages, and sales collateral should include appropriate disclaimers** where Qumis capabilities are described in terms of legal analysis. Standard disclaimer language: "Qumis provides coverage intelligence and analysis tools. Qumis output does not constitute legal advice. Users should consult qualified legal counsel for formal legal opinions."
- **In sales conversations**, if a prospect asks "Is this legal advice?" the answer is: "No — Qumis provides attorney-grade coverage analysis that supports your team's decision-making. For matters requiring a formal legal opinion, we recommend consulting qualified counsel. Many of our customers use Qumis to handle the 80% of coverage questions that don't require outside counsel, and to better prepare for the 20% that do."

---

## Tone Principles

These govern *how* Qumis communicates, not just *what* it says:

1. **Confident, not arrogant.** Qumis has earned the right to be assertive about its capabilities — real customers, real metrics, real differentiation. But insurance is a relationship business built on trust. Overconfident claims alienate the exact buyers you're targeting. Let proof points carry the weight
2. **Precise, not technical.** Insurance professionals respect precision in language — it's literally their profession. Vague claims ("better," "smarter," "faster") without specifics feel like marketing. Specific claims ("8x faster policy review," "citation-linked to source policy language") feel like someone who understands the work
3. **Respectful of the profession.** Insurance coverage professionals are experts. They've spent decades building judgment that AI cannot fully replicate. Qumis messaging should never imply their work is simple, rote, or easily automated. The frame is always amplification, not replacement
4. **Domain-fluent.** Use insurance terminology correctly. "Insured," not "customer." "Exclusion," not "carve-out" (unless in the correct technical context). "Endorsement," not "rider" (unless discussing personal lines). Getting the language right signals that Qumis was built by someone who practiced in this space — because it was
5. **Direct over clever.** Insurance professionals are skeptical of marketing polish. Plain, direct language outperforms clever copywriting every time

# Objection Handling

> **Warning:** This content is confidential and for internal use only. Do not share with prospects or external parties.

This section arms your team for the hardest moments in sales conversations. Each objection includes the initial response, the most likely follow-up, and the response to that follow-up. Objections rarely end after one exchange — prepare for the conversation, not just the question.

> **Info:** **Principles for all objection handling:**
>
> 1. **Acknowledge before countering.** Dismissing a prospect's concern makes them defensive. Validating it builds trust
> 2. **Lead with Qumis, not competitors.** Spend more time on what you are than what they aren't
> 3. **Land on market intelligence when possible.** The proprietary data asset is the argument that ends objection conversations
> 4. **Use proof points.** Abstract claims are forgettable. Specific customer stories are persuasive

## The 10 Objections

### Objection 1: "How is this different from ChatGPT?"

*This is the most common objection. It takes multiple forms depending on who's asking.*

**Initial Response:** Qumis is a purpose-built coverage intelligence platform — built by a licensed coverage attorney, trained on insurance-specific reasoning frameworks, and backed by a proprietary database of thousands of real commercial insurance programs. Every output is citation-linked to the source policy language, so you can verify any conclusion. And when the evidence is ambiguous or insufficient, Qumis tells you — it says "I don't know" rather than guessing. That's not how ChatGPT works. Generic AI has no insurance domain expertise, no proprietary data, no citation architecture, and no safeguards against confident wrong answers. In insurance, a confident wrong answer creates liability.

**Follow-up: "But ChatGPT is free / much cheaper. Isn't it good enough for most tasks?"**

For basic document search, maybe. But coverage analysis isn't basic document search — it requires understanding how exclusions interact with definitions, how endorsements modify coverage, and how sublimits affect recovery. ChatGPT treats a policy as undifferentiated text. Qumis understands the structural roles of every provision. And here's the part generic AI can never replicate: Qumis benchmarks coverage against thousands of real commercial programs. When Qumis identifies a coverage gap, it can tell you how that gap compares to what carriers are writing across comparable programs in your industry. ChatGPT has no proprietary insurance data whatsoever.

**Follow-up: "AI is improving fast. Won't GPT-5 or GPT-6 solve this?"**

Foundation models are improving rapidly — which actually makes our position stronger, not weaker. As generic AI gets better, the *generic* layer commoditizes. What becomes more valuable is the domain-specific intelligence layer: the legal reasoning frameworks, the insurance taxonomies, the proprietary market data accumulated from thousands of real programs, and the understanding of how policy language gets interpreted in practice. That's what Qumis is. We ride the improvement curve of foundation models while maintaining the domain expertise and data moat that generic tools can never replicate. The gap doesn't close over time — it widens.

### Objection 2: "We already have \[workflow automation tool]"

**Initial Response:** That's actually a great foundation. Workflow tools like that are strong at operational efficiency — submissions intake, data movement, document processing. Qumis does something different: we deliver coverage intelligence — understanding what the policy actually means, identifying coverage gaps, and benchmarking coverage against market standards. Think of it this way: your workflow tool can tell you two policies are different. Qumis tells you what those differences mean for coverage and how they compare to what the rest of the market is writing. Many of our customers use both — the workflow tool for operational speed, Qumis for analytical depth. We're the intelligence layer that makes the entire stack smarter.

**Follow-up: "That sounds like we'd be paying for two tools that overlap."**

Different budget, different value, different users. Your workflow tool serves operations teams processing high volumes of documents. Qumis serves coverage professionals — the people who need to understand, interpret, and defend policy positions. There's almost no user overlap. And the ROI model is completely different: workflow tools save time on administrative tasks. Qumis prevents coverage errors, identifies gaps your team might miss, and provides the market context that supports better coverage decisions. One of our customers — a senior claims advocate at a top-5 broker — recovered an additional $1.8M in claims in a single month using Qumis. That's not an efficiency gain. That's a revenue outcome no workflow tool delivers.

### Objection 3: "How do I know I can trust the AI output?"

**Initial Response:** This is exactly the right question, and it's why we built Qumis the way we did. Three things make Qumis output trustworthy in a way generic AI is not. First, every conclusion is citation-linked to the source policy language — you click any finding and see exactly which provision it came from. Second, we built "I don't know" safeguards into the system on purpose. When the evidence is ambiguous or a document is unclear, Qumis flags it rather than guessing. In insurance, a confidently wrong answer is worse than no answer at all. Third, Qumis creates an auditable documentation trail — analysis that's traceable, defensible, and suitable for regulatory or litigation scrutiny.

**Follow-up: "But how accurate is it really? What's your error rate?"**

We don't publish a single accuracy number because accuracy varies by policy type, complexity, and use case — and anyone who gives you a single percentage is oversimplifying. What we can tell you is this: one of our users — a senior claims adjuster at a specialty carrier — told us Qumis caught a reefer exclusion buried in a 1,000-page policy that he had missed. He was already negotiating a settlement. That single catch saved $21,000 on one claim. And a senior claims technical director at the same carrier described Qumis as a "second pair of eyes" that "confirms what you're thinking, or flags areas you need to look at." The trust architecture isn't about a percentage — it's about citations, safeguards, and the ability to verify everything the system tells you.

### Objection 4: "Is this going to replace my team?"

**Initial Response:** No — and we designed it that way deliberately. Qumis is a force multiplier for your existing team, not a replacement. Your senior coverage professionals still make the decisions, still exercise judgment, still manage client relationships. What Qumis does is make sure every member of your team operates with the same analytical depth and market context as your most experienced people. Think of it as giving each person on your team a tireless coverage expert who has already read the entire policy and analyzed it against thousands of comparable programs — so your people can focus on the judgment calls that actually require their expertise.

**Follow-up: "My team is worried about this. How do I get buy-in?"**

The practitioners who are most skeptical upfront often become the strongest advocates. One of our users, Joanne Snow — a Senior Claims Technical Director at Skyward Specialty who handles complex D\&O and management liability claims — put it this way: "I use it as a checklist to make sure I'm looking at everything I need to. It gives you a second pair of eyes — confirms what you're thinking, or flags areas you need to look at." That's how experienced professionals actually use Qumis — not as a replacement for their expertise, but as a tool that makes their expertise more thorough and consistent. The best way to build buy-in is a focused pilot with your most demanding team members. When your toughest critics see Qumis catch something they missed on their own policies, adoption follows naturally.

### Objection 5: "What about security and compliance?"

**Initial Response:** We're SOC 2 Type I certified and built specifically for enterprise insurance deployment. Three things that matter most for your security review: client data is never used for AI model training — your policies stay your policies. We maintain strict data isolation between tenants — no client can access another client's data. And we provide enterprise-grade access controls including SSO and MFA. Multiple top 15 U.S. brokerages put us through their full security review process and approved us for production use with their most sensitive policy documents.

**Follow-up: "We need to run this through our InfoSec team. What does that look like?"**

We've been through rigorous security reviews with major enterprise brokerages and can provide your InfoSec team with our SOC 2 report, security questionnaire responses, and architecture documentation. Typical security reviews take two to four weeks. We're happy to schedule a technical call with your security team directly — our CTO has led enterprise security implementations at Goldman Sachs and can speak their language.

### Objection 6: "How long does implementation take?"

**Initial Response:** Most teams are productive within days. Qumis is cloud-based — no on-premise installation, no complex integration required. You upload policies and start analyzing them. There's no heavy IT lift, which is why our typical implementation timeline is days to weeks, not months. For teams wanting deeper integration with existing systems — AMS platforms like Applied Epic or Sagitta, document management systems, email workflows — we have APIs and can scope a phased rollout.

**Follow-up: "What does the rollout typically look like?"**

Most customers start with a focused deployment — a specific practice group, a specific use case like renewals or claims analysis — and expand as they see results. That's how NFP went from a 50-seat pilot focused on their middle-market team to 250+ production users across multiple practice groups including construction. We provide hands-on onboarding, training tailored to your team's workflows, and ongoing customer success support. The goal is time to value in the first week, measurable impact in the first month.

### Objection 7: "We tried \[other AI tool] and it didn't work"

**Initial Response:** That's a common experience, and frankly it's why many of our best customers came to us — they were burned by generic AI that doesn't understand insurance. Most AI tools applied to insurance are either general-purpose models with an insurance interface or workflow automation tools that don't attempt real coverage analysis. Qumis is neither. Our founder is a licensed coverage attorney who experienced the failures of generic AI on real coverage questions and built Qumis specifically to solve what those tools couldn't. The reasoning frameworks in the platform are the same ones coverage counsel use — encoded in software, backed by a proprietary database of thousands of real commercial programs.

**Follow-up: "How do I know this time will be different?"**

Two things. First, let us show you on your actual policies. We'll run a pilot on your documents, not a demo on ours. When you see Qumis accurately analyze a layered program or identify a coverage gap in a policy you know well, you'll see the difference immediately. Second, ask us the hard questions — not simple policy lookups, but the nuanced coverage questions that tripped up whatever tool you used before. We had a user — Connor Love, National Director of Growth at IMA — who told us he initially thought "There's no way this will catch everything." After using it on layered programs and seeing it track discrepancies he might have missed, he was sold. Let your skeptics put us to the test. That's how we win.

### Objection 8: "This is too expensive" / "We don't have the budget"

**Initial Response:** I understand — let me reframe what you're actually comparing against. The alternative to Qumis isn't free. It's the cost of the manual process: your most experienced people spending hours on policy reviews that Qumis handles in minutes. It's the coverage gap that gets missed because there wasn't time for a thorough review. It's the outside counsel engagement at $500 to $800 an hour for a coverage question Qumis could have answered immediately. One of our customers, Brian Pilarski at Kapnick, told us Qumis eliminated the need for an additional hire while making their reviews faster and more accurate. That single hire would have cost significantly more than Qumis across a full team.

**Follow-up: "Can we start smaller?"**

Absolutely — that's exactly how most of our enterprise customers deploy. Start with a focused team of 10 to 20 users on a specific use case. Measure the impact over 90 days. Then expand based on results. That's the motion that drove NFP from 50 seats to 250+ and gives us 127% net revenue retention across our customer base. We're confident enough in the value that we want you to prove it to yourself before scaling.

### Objection 9: "Our IT team can build this internally"

**Initial Response:** Building a document chat interface on top of a foundation model is straightforward — your team could have that running in weeks. But that's not what Qumis is. Building a platform that delivers legal-grade coverage analysis with citation-linked outputs, multi-agent validation, insurance-specific taxonomies, "I don't know" safeguards, and proprietary market benchmarking drawn from thousands of real commercial programs — that's a multi-year, multi-million-dollar effort that requires deep insurance domain expertise your engineering team doesn't have. And there's one thing you can never build internally: the proprietary data asset. That requires thousands of real commercial programs analyzed over years of enterprise customer relationships.

**Follow-up: "We have insurance domain experts who could guide the build."**

Domain experts are critical — and they should be the ones using Qumis, not spending their time as product managers for an internal AI project. Every month your team spends building, your competitors are already using coverage intelligence to win accounts and identify gaps. The question isn't whether your team *could* build something — it's whether that's the highest-value use of your most expensive people's time, and whether you can reach the level of accuracy, market data, and coverage reasoning that Qumis delivers today.

### Objection 10: "We need to see it work on our policies first"

*Note: This is a buying signal, not a true objection. Treat it as forward momentum.*

**Response:** That's exactly how we prefer to start. Generic demos on sample policies don't prove anything. Let's set up a focused pilot on your actual documents — the policies your team knows best — so you can evaluate the analysis against your own expertise. Most pilots run two to four weeks with a defined scope: a specific practice group, a specific line of business, or a specific use case like renewals or claims analysis. Our customer success team provides hands-on onboarding and is available throughout. When your team sees Qumis accurately analyze the policies they've spent years learning, the conversation changes.

# Ascend Program

Source: internal/messaging/ascend-program

> **Warning:** This content is confidential and for internal use only. Do not share with prospects or external parties.

Ascend is Qumis's evidence-backed implementation and change management program. It is a core differentiator in enterprise sales conversations — not a professional services add-on, but a built-in component of every enterprise engagement. This section covers why Ascend exists, how to position it, and why no competitor can replicate it.

## Why Ascend Exists: The Evidence Base

Every element of Ascend traces back to real deployment data, not borrowed consulting methodology. Three findings from our own platform data and enterprise deployment experience shaped the program:

### The Activation Threshold

Users who analyze 20 or more documents within their first 30 days retain at 81%. Users below that threshold retain at 36% — a 45-percentage-point gap. Ascend is designed to drive every user past that threshold within the critical first month.

### The Ghost User Problem

When we scaled enterprise accounts without structured change management, ghost rates — users who received licenses but never activated — increased sevenfold. At one account, nearly half of provisioned users never logged in. The technology was identical. What was missing was structured onboarding, internal champion development, and workflow-specific use case design. Ascend was built to prevent this.

### The Center of Excellence Pattern

Our highest-performing accounts (90–100% active rates, 3–5x higher per-user engagement) share a common structure: they have internal "architects" — experienced coverage professionals who define how the team uses Qumis and serve as the go-to resource for colleagues. Ascend systematically creates this pattern at every deployment rather than hoping it emerges organically.

---

## How to Position Ascend

Ascend is not "onboarding." It is a structured, phased deployment program — discovery, pilot, validated expansion, ongoing optimization — designed by insurance professionals who understand coverage workflows at a practitioner level.

> **Tip:** **Core message:** Qumis has deployed coverage intelligence at five of the top 15 U.S. brokerages and learned exactly what drives adoption and what kills it. Ascend is those lessons encoded into a repeatable program backed by real data.

The framing is always "this is how we ensure you succeed" — never "this is an extra service we offer." Ascend should appear in the sales process during discovery, not at contracting. When a prospect asks "what does implementation look like?", Ascend is the answer.

### By Audience

### Brokerage Executives & Operations

Ascend is how you de-risk an AI deployment. Most AI implementations in insurance fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because the change management isn't there. Our structured deployments achieve 90%+ active utilization rates, compared to the 47% industry average for enterprise SaaS license utilization. We built Ascend because we've seen both sides — we know what works and what doesn't, and we don't succeed unless your team actually uses the platform.

### IT & Operations Decision-Makers

Ascend minimizes the IT lift and maximizes adoption speed. We handle change management, role-specific training, and ongoing support so your team doesn't have to build an internal AI enablement function from scratch. Typical timeline: productive users within days, measurable impact within 30 days, validated expansion within 90 days.

### Department Heads & Team Leaders

Ascend means your team isn't left to figure it out on their own. We build custom prompt libraries and analytical frameworks specific to your lines of business, provide hands-on training using your actual policies, and develop internal champions on your team who become the go-to experts — so adoption sustains long after formal onboarding ends.

### Skeptical Practitioners

This is exactly why we built Ascend. We've seen what happens when AI tools get dropped on insurance professionals without proper context — they try it once, get confused, and never come back. Ascend is different because it's designed by people who've done coverage work professionally. The training uses your actual policies, not generic demos. The prompt templates reflect how coverage professionals actually think. And we track activation in real time — if someone is stuck, we know within days and intervene before they disengage.

---

## Ascend as Competitive Differentiator

Ascend is a competitive moat that workflow automation vendors and generic AI tools cannot replicate because it requires three things they don't have:

**Insurance domain expertise.** The people designing and delivering Ascend understand coverage analysis at a professional level. They can build prompt libraries that reflect how a D\&O specialist thinks differently from a construction practice leader. They can facilitate training using real coverage questions and diagnose whether low adoption is a product issue, a workflow fit issue, or a training gap. Generic AI vendors can train users on their interface. They cannot train users on coverage analysis.

**Proprietary deployment data.** The activation thresholds, engagement benchmarks, champion patterns, and expansion triggers come from real usage data across hundreds of enterprise insurance users. This is evidence-based activation science specific to AI adoption in insurance, not theoretical change management methodology.

**A proven expansion playbook.** The phased approach — pilot to validated expansion to full deployment — has been refined through engagements that grew from initial pilots to hundreds of production users. The expansion path from 50 seats to 250+ that we've executed at enterprise accounts happened because the Ascend framework systematically creates the conditions for growth: executive sponsorship, internal champions, quantified impact, and a clear business case for the next phase.

> **Info:** When a prospect asks "what makes your implementation different?", the answer is: our competitors can provision accounts. They can't do this.

---

## Ascend Proof Points

| Metric | Data Point |
| ----- | ----- |
| Activation threshold | 81% retention for users reaching 20+ documents in 30 days vs. 36% below |
| Active utilization (structured) | 90%+ at Kapnick, Morris & Garritano vs. 47% industry SaaS average |
| Ghost rate improvement | Less than 5% at structured deployments vs. 29% when scaling without Ascend |
| Pilot conversion | 100% of companies completing a structured pilot become paying customers |
| Expansion velocity | 50 to 250+ users at NFP following phased model |
| Per-user engagement | 383–718 at structured deployments vs. 126 at unstructured |
| Time to productivity | Days, not months |

---

## Key Phrases for Ascend Conversations

- "We've deployed at five of the top 15 U.S. brokerages. Ascend is everything we learned about what drives adoption — encoded into a program."
- "Our structured deployments achieve 90%+ utilization. The industry average for enterprise SaaS is 47%. The difference is change management."
- "We don't just give your team a login. We build the workflows, develop the champions, and stay engaged until adoption is self-sustaining."
- "Whatever we do, it's got to be a contained, systematic rollout that shows we know what we're doing and we've done it before." *(Internal framing — captures the Ascend philosophy.)*

# Data & Privacy Messaging

Source: internal/messaging/data-privacy

> **Warning:** This content is confidential and for internal use only. Do not share with prospects or external parties.

This section governs how Qumis talks about customer data and AI. Every claim must be accurate to the actual architecture and contractual commitments. The language is precise for a reason — imprecise data messaging either creates legal liability or forfeits competitive positioning.

## The Core Tension

Qumis's positioning depends on two commitments that sound contradictory:

1. "Your data is never used to train large language models."
2. "Qumis has proprietary intelligence built from thousands of commercial insurance programs."

These are not contradictory. They describe different activities happening to different forms of data. The first refers to customer-identifiable data, which is always private and siloed. The second refers to de-identified, aggregated coverage intelligence — patterns, structures, benchmarks — that cannot be traced back to any customer. Your team must be able to explain this distinction clearly. When they can't, trust collapses.

> **Info:** **The precise commitment:** Qumis does not use customer data to train general-purpose or foundational large language models. Qumis does build proprietary knowledge infrastructure and specialized domain capabilities from de-identified, aggregated coverage intelligence. These are architecturally and contractually distinct activities. The prohibition is specific. The permitted uses are specific. Both are in the MSA (Section 8.5 and Section 4.4).

### What Your Team Needs to Understand

- **Customer-identifiable data** — policies, analysis outputs, usage history — is logically segregated, never visible to other customers, never used to train any model, and deleted within 60 days of termination
- **Third-party AI providers** process customer data for inference only. They are contractually prohibited from training on it
- **De-identified, aggregated intelligence** — coverage language patterns, carrier behaviors, endorsement structures, market benchmarks — is derived from customer data but stripped of identifying information. It powers Qumis's market intelligence features and is used to improve the platform, including developing specialized domain capabilities like classifiers, quality scoring, and analytical tools. This is standard practice for vertical AI platforms and is analogous to how a credit bureau derives market benchmarks from individual account data
- **User feedback signals** (thumbs up/down, corrections) inform product improvement. They are about output quality, not customer documents

---

## The Questions Your Team Will Get

### "Do you use our data to train your AI?"

"We do not use your data to train large language models — not ours, not any third-party provider's. That's a contractual commitment. Separately, Qumis maintains a proprietary knowledge base built from de-identified coverage patterns across thousands of programs — that's what powers our market intelligence and benchmarking. But that's aggregated and de-identified. It doesn't contain anyone's specific policies."

### "How can you have market intelligence if you don't use customer data?"

"We distinguish between customer data — always private, always siloed — and de-identified coverage intelligence derived from thousands of programs. The knowledge base captures patterns: how carriers structure exclusions, what coverage terms look like across industries. It never contains specific policies or identifying information. It's like how a credit bureau provides market benchmarks without exposing any individual's account."

### "Is our data commingled with other customers'?"

"No. Your data is logically segregated — no other customer can access or view it. Our market intelligence layer is a separate, de-identified knowledge base. Architecturally distinct from any customer's identifiable data."

### "What third-party AI providers do you use?"

"Enterprise-grade providers that are contractually prohibited from training on your data. We don't disclose specific providers because those relationships may evolve. What matters is the contractual protection — that's in our MSA."

### "Do you build your own AI models from customer data?"

"Qumis develops specialized coverage analysis capabilities — classification, quality scoring, extraction — using de-identified, aggregated intelligence from our knowledge base. No customer's identifiable data is used. This is how every serious vertical AI platform works — it's how we continuously improve accuracy while maintaining complete data privacy."

### "What happens to our data if we leave?"

"All customer data is securely deleted within 60 days. Any de-identified intelligence derived from aggregated patterns during your time on the platform persists in the knowledge base — but by definition, that data doesn't identify you or contain your specific policies."

### "Will you sign our AI data usage addendum?"

"Happy to review it. Our MSA Sections 8.5 and 4.4 already address data isolation, model training restrictions, third-party providers, and aggregated data. Let me share the relevant sections so your legal team can compare."

---

## Language Discipline

| Use | Avoid | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| "Never used to train large language models" | "Never used to train AI" / "never used for training" | The commitment is specific to foundational LLMs. Broader language forecloses domain-specific capabilities built on de-identified data |
| "Logically segregated" | "Physically isolated" / "dedicated environment" | Logical segregation is what you provide. Physical isolation implies infrastructure you don't offer |
| "De-identified, aggregated intelligence" | "Anonymized data" | More precise. "Anonymized" has specific legal definitions that may not match your process |
| "Proprietary knowledge base" / "coverage intelligence layer" | "Our database of customer policies" | Positions the asset correctly — as derived intelligence, not collected documents |
| "Specialized domain capabilities" | "Our AI models trained on data" | Describes the same thing without triggering the training fear response |
| "Processed through AI models" | "Fed into AI" / "sent to AI" | "Processed" is clinical. "Fed" sounds careless |
| "Contractually prohibited" | "We promise" / "we don't do that" | Contractual language is stronger than verbal assurances |
| "Enterprise-grade AI providers" | Naming specific providers | Relationships may change. Naming invites comparison to consumer products |
| "Derived data structures" | "Graph database" / "knowledge graph" (customer-facing) | Technically accurate, doesn't attract scrutiny |

---

## Red Lines: What Your Team Must Never Say

> **Warning:** These statements create legal liability or destroy trust. Do not use under any circumstances.

- **"We never use your data for anything except your own analysis."** — Conflicts with MSA Section 4.4. If legal reads this statement and then reads the contract, trust collapses
- **"We built our own large language model."** — You use third-party foundation models with a proprietary intelligence layer. This claim invites scrutiny you can't survive
- **"Your data never leaves our servers."** — Customer data is processed through third-party providers for inference. This will be caught in any serious security review
- **"We train our AI on customer data to make the platform better."** — Conflates multiple distinct activities into the single statement buyers fear most. Indefensible in a sales context even though elements are technically true for the de-identified layer
- **"Our AI is 100% accurate" / "Our AI never hallucinates."** — Creates legal liability. Use citation-linked outputs and "I don't know" safeguards framing

---

## Internal Note

> **Info:** The "large language models" qualifier throughout this section is deliberate and must not be softened to "any AI" or "any models." The MSA prohibits training "general-purpose or foundational" large language models on customer data. It does not prohibit building specialized domain capabilities from de-identified aggregated data under Section 4.4. This precise language preserves full product optionality — graph databases, classifiers, evaluators, scoring models, SLMs — while maintaining an honest, defensible commitment to customers. If a customer's legal team pushes to narrow the aggregated data or permitted uses provisions, escalate to Dan.

# Tools Setup

Source: internal/engineering/tools-setup

This guide covers the installation and configuration of all essential tools for Qumis development.

## qumis-cli Installation

> **Info:** **qumis-cli** is our internal CLI tool that streamlines development workflows, deployments, and operations.
>
> Repository: [github.com/qumisinc/qumis-cli](https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-cli) (Private)

### Prerequisites for qumis-cli

```bash
# Check Go version (need 1.21+)
go version

# If Go is not installed or outdated:
brew install go
# OR use asdf for version management:
asdf plugin-add golang
asdf install golang 1.21.0
asdf global golang 1.21.0
```

### Install qumis-cli

```bash Full Install (Recommended)
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-cli.git
cd qumis-cli

# Build and install
make deploy

# Verify installation
qumis --version

# Add shell integration to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
echo "source $(pwd)/shell/qumis.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

```bash Binary Only
git clone https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-cli.git /tmp/qumis-cli && \
cd /tmp/qumis-cli && \
make deploy && \
cd - && \
rm -rf /tmp/qumis-cli
```

> **Note:** **Full Install** includes shell integration with helpful aliases and completions. **Binary Only** is faster but lacks these conveniences.

### Configure qumis-cli

### Generate GitHub Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` and `workflow`
4. Generate and copy the token

```bash
qumis config github.token <your-github-token>
```

### Configure Linear API Key

1. Go to [Linear Settings → API](https://linear.app/settings/api)
2. Create a new personal API key
3. Copy the key

```bash
qumis config linear.token <your-linear-api-key>
```

### Verify Configuration

Run the diagnostic command:

```bash
qumis doctor
```

This should show all green checkmarks for configured services.

## Essential Development Tools

# Git Branching Strategies

Source: internal/engineering/guides/git-branching-strategies

## Video Walkthrough

A walkthrough of how to keep your feature branches in sync with the release branch and resolve merge conflicts when they arise.

### Quick Reference - Update Your Branch

### Choose your update strategy:

```bash Rebase (Recommended)
git checkout release
git pull origin release
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase release
git push --force-with-lease
```

```bash Merge (Safer)
git checkout release
git pull origin release
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge release
git push
```

> **Info:** **Rebase** creates a clean linear history. **Merge** preserves the exact timeline without requiring force push.

> **Warning:** If you see conflicts, you'll need to resolve them. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## The Core Problem

Since we are growing our engineering team and we will all merging PRs to the same branch asynchronously, we will regularly be out of sync.

**If another engineer merged their PR to `release` while you were working, your feature branch will be behind `origin/release`**

When your feature branch falls behind the remote release branch, creating a PR without updating causes:

- Other people's commits appearing in your PR
- Confused code reviewers
- Hidden feature scope
- Difficult merge conflicts
- Misleading git blame history

If you are out of sync, you will not reliably be able to ensure merging your feature branch will not introduce issues.

### What This Looks Like

**Out of Sync:**

```mermaid
---
config:
  logLevel: 'debug'
  theme: 'default'
  themeVariables:
      'git1': '#F0BF00'
---
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B"
    branch your-feature
    checkout your-feature
    commit id: "X (your work)"
    commit id: "Y (your work)"
    checkout main
    commit id: "C (colleague's work)"
    commit id: "D (colleague's work)"
    checkout your-feature
    commit id: "Z (your work)"
```

### What It Should Look Like

**In Sync:**

```mermaid
---
config:
  logLevel: 'debug'
  theme: 'default'
  themeVariables:
      'git1': '#00ff00'
---
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B"
    commit id: "C (colleague's)"
    commit id: "D (colleague's)"
    branch your-feature
    checkout your-feature
    commit id: "X' (your work)"
    commit id: "Y' (your work)"
    commit id: "Z' (your work)"
```

## Step-by-Step: Rebase (Recommended)

> **Tip:** Claude Code makes rebase or merge conflicts much easier! [See the Claude Code](#claude-code-can-help-with-conflicts) section.

✅ **Use this for**: Regular feature branches, bug fixes, most daily work

### Update your local release branch

```bash
git checkout release
git pull origin release
```

### Switch to your feature branch

```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch  # e.g., erik/eng-984-add-auth
```

### Rebase onto the updated release

```bash
git rebase release
```

### Force push safely

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

> **Warning:** Never use `--force` alone. Always use `--force-with-lease` for safety.

### If You Hit Conflicts

### Fix the conflicted files

Your editor will show `<<<<` markers indicating conflicts. Review and resolve each conflict.

### Stage the fixed files

```bash
git add .
```

### Continue rebasing

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

### Repeat if more conflicts appear

If additional conflicts occur, repeat steps 1-3 until the rebase completes.

> **Tip:** **Escape hatch**: If things go wrong, run `git rebase --abort` to undo everything.

## Step-by-Step: Merge (Alternative)

⚠️ **Use this for**: Long-running features, when rebase is too complex, or if you're not comfortable with force pushing

### Update your local release branch

```bash
git checkout release
git pull origin release
```

### Switch to your feature branch

```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch
```

### Merge release into your branch

```bash
git merge release
```

### Push normally

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

## Our Branching Model

```
main (production)
└─ release (staging)
   ├─ erik/eng-983-feature-one
   ├─ sarah/eng-984-feature-two
   └─ alex/eng-985-feature-three
```

- **Branch naming**: `engineer-name/ticket-id-description`
- **Base branch**: Always branch from `release`
- **Target branch**: Always merge back to `release`

## The Two Solutions

### Quick Comparison

| | Rebase (Recommended) | Merge (Alternative) |
|---|---|---|
| **Result** | Clean, linear history | Preserves exact timeline |
| **Safety** | Requires `--force-with-lease` | Normal push |
| **Best For** | Most feature work | Long-running branches |
| **Complexity** | Moderate | Simple |

> **Info:** **Our Recommendation**: Use **rebase** for feature branches. It keeps our Git history clean and makes code reviews easier. Only use merge if you're uncomfortable with rebase or working on a long-running feature.

### Claude Code Can Help With Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts during a rebase, Claude Code can help you resolve them:

```bash
# When you hit conflicts during rebase, ask Claude:
claude "I'm currently in the middle of a rebase that has merge conflicts. Can you help me resolve them and finish the rebase?"
```

Claude Code will analyze the conflicts, help you resolve them, and complete the rebase process.

### Making Rebasing Easier - Recommended Git Config

These git configurations will make rebasing smoother and more automated:

```bash
# Remember how you resolved conflicts and reuse those resolutions
git config --global rerere.enabled true
git config --global rerere.autoUpdate true

# Automatically stash and unstash changes during rebase
git config --global rebase.autoStash true
```

> **Tip:** **What these settings do:**
>
> - `rerere` (REuse REcorded REsolution) remembers how you resolved conflicts and applies them automatically next time
> - `autosquash` automatically reorders commits marked with `fixup!` or `squash!`
> - `autoStash` stashes any uncommitted changes before rebasing and applies them after

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems & Solutions

### I see merge conflicts

```bash
# For rebase conflicts:
# 1. Fix conflicts in your editor (look for <<<< markers)
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Too many conflicts? Abort and try merge instead:
git rebase --abort
git merge release  # Try merge strategy instead
```

### I accidentally pushed to the wrong branch

```bash
# Undo the last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
# Switch to correct branch
git checkout -b correct-branch-name
# Commit and push to right place
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin correct-branch-name
```

### My PR still shows other people's commits

You forgot to update your branch. Follow the [Quick Fix](#emergency-need-to-fix-your-branch-right-now) at the top of this guide.

### Git says 'cannot push' after rebase

You need to force push after rebasing:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

### I want to start over completely

```bash
# Save your work first!
git stash
# Reset to match remote release
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/release
# Apply your changes back
git stash pop
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Update your branch **before** creating a PR
- Use `--force-with-lease` (never just `--force`)
- Pull from `release` at least once daily
- Ask for help if confused (#engineering channel)
- Test your code after updating

### 🛑 DON'T

- Create PRs without updating first
- Force push to `main` or `release`
- Rebase commits others are using
- Mix rebase and merge randomly
- Panic

## Command Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Update your branch (Rebase)
git checkout release && git pull
git checkout your-branch
git rebase release
git push --force-with-lease

# Update your branch (Merge)
git checkout release && git pull
git checkout your-branch
git merge release
git push

# Emergency exits
git rebase --abort      # Cancel a rebase
git merge --abort       # Cancel a merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1 # Undo last commit (destructive!)
```

# 1. Check service health
qumis services info api --env prod
qumis services info web --env prod

# 2. Verify health endpoints
curl https://api.qumis.ai/health
curl https://app.qumis.ai/health

# 3. Check for errors (last 5 min)

  --workflow-ref "release" \
  --confirm
```

## Emergency Contacts

For production incidents:

1. Check [CloudWatch Alerts](/internal/engineering/infrastructure/cloudwatch-alerts)
2. Review [Common Issues](/internal/engineering/troubleshooting/common-issues)
3. Escalate to on-call engineer via PagerDuty

## Best Practices

> **Warning:**&#x20;
>
> - **Always verify UAT** before deploying to production
> - **Use descriptive reasons** for all production commands (audit trail)
> - **Monitor for 15 minutes** after deployment
> - **Have rollback plan ready** before deploying
> - **Communicate** with team before production changes

---

# Production Deployment

Source: internal/engineering/deployment/production-deployment

> **Warning:** **Production deployments require**:
>
> - Code review approval on your PR
> - Successful deployment to UAT
> - Team lead or senior engineer approval
> - Proper audit log reason

## Prerequisites

Before deploying to production:

1. **qumis-cli installed**: See [Tools Setup](/internal/engineering/tools-setup)
2. **AWS Production access**: Verify with `qumis aws login prod`
3. **GitHub access**: Ensure your PR is approved and merged
4. **Deployment window**: Check #deployments channel for scheduled windows

## Deployment Process

> **Note:** **Interactive Confirmation for Production**: When deploying to production, the qumis-cli will display deployment details and prompt you to manually confirm by typing:
>
> 1. The deploy branch name (e.g., "release")
> 2. The environment name ("prod")
>
> This two-step confirmation replaces the previous `--confirm` flag and helps prevent accidental production deployments.

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Checks

### Verify UAT Deployment

Ensure your changes are deployed and tested in UAT:

```bash
# Check UAT deployment status
qumis services info api --env uat

# Verify your changes are in UAT
qumis services exec api --env uat --reason "Verify deployment" -- rails runner "puts 'Version check'"
```

### Check Production Status

Verify current production state:

```bash
# Check current production version
qumis services info api --env prod

# Check current Lambda functions
qumis lambda list-functions --env prod
```

### Review Deployment Checklist

Go through the [Deployment Checklist](/internal/engineering/deployment/deployment-checklist) to ensure all items are completed.

### Step 2: Deploy to Production

### API Service

Deploy the Rails API service:

```bash
qumis deploy api \
  --deploy-branch "release" \
  --env "prod" \
  --reason "Deploy feature XYZ - Ticket ENG-123" \
  --workflow-ref "release"
```

> **Info:** **Interactive Confirmation**: For production deployments, the CLI will prompt you to manually type:
>
> - The deploy branch name (e.g., "release")
> - The environment name ("prod")
>
> This replaces the previous `--confirm` flag for added safety.

### Web Service

Deploy the web application:

```bash
qumis deploy web \
  --deploy-branch "release" \
  --env "prod" \
  --reason "Deploy UI updates - Ticket ENG-124" \
  --workflow-ref "release"
```

### LLM Service

> **Warning:** **Note**: `qumis deploy llm` is not yet available. Use the serverless command below from the `llm-service` repository.

Deploy the LLM service from the `llm-service` repository:

```bash
npx serverless deploy \
  --config serverless-qumis.yml \
  --stage prod \
  --verbose \
  --org qumis \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --aws-profile qumis_prod
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

### Watch GitHub Actions

Monitor the deployment workflow in GitHub Actions:

**Direct Links:**

- API Service: [github.com/qumisinc/qumis-api/actions](https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-api/actions)
- Web Service: [github.com/qumisinc/qumis-web/actions](https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-web/actions)

Look for the workflow triggered by your deployment command.

### Monitor CloudWatch Logs

Watch for errors during deployment:

```bash
# Tail Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod --profile qumis_prod --follow

# Check for errors
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '5 minutes ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Verify Deployment

Confirm the deployment succeeded:

```bash
# Check service info
qumis services info api --env prod

# Run a health check
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Post-deployment health check" \
  -- rails runner "puts 'Health: OK'"
```

## Deployment Commands Reference

### Required Flags

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--deploy-branch` | Git branch to deploy | `"release"` or `"hotfix-123"` |
| `--env` | Target environment | `"prod"` |
| `--reason` | Audit log reason | `"Deploy feature XYZ"` |
| `--workflow-ref` | GitHub workflow branch | `"release"` |

### Environment Mapping

| Environment | AWS Account | Confirmation Required |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| dev | 080970846004 | No |
| qa | 340452546718 | No |
| uat | 499854674638 | No |
| **prod** | **729033428609** | **Yes** (type branch & env) |

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate Verification

1. **Check application health**:
   ```bash
   # API health check
   curl https://api.qumis.ai/health

   # Web application check
   curl https://app.qumis.ai
   ```

2. **Monitor error rates**:
   ```bash
   # Check CloudWatch metrics
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
     --namespace AWS/Lambda \
     --metric-name Errors \
     --dimensions Name=FunctionName,Value=qumis-api-prod \
     --start-time $(date -u -d '10 minutes ago' --iso-8601) \
     --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
     --period 300 \
     --statistics Sum \
     --profile qumis_prod
   ```

3. **Verify key functionality**:
   - Test login flow
   - Check critical API endpoints
   - Verify database connectivity

### Communication

### Update Deployment Channel

Post in #deployments:

```
✅ Production deployment complete
Service: API
Version: [commit SHA]
Reason: Deploy feature XYZ - ENG-123
Status: Healthy
```

### Update Linear Ticket

Mark the ticket as deployed:

```bash
# If using linear-cli
linear issue update ENG-123 --status "Deployed"
```

## Rollback Procedures

If issues are detected after deployment:

> **Warning:** **Act quickly but calmly**. Follow the [Rollback Procedures](/internal/engineering/deployment/rollback-procedures) guide.

Quick rollback command:

```bash
# Deploy the previous version
qumis deploy api \
  --deploy-branch "release" \
  --env "prod" \
  --reason "ROLLBACK: Issues detected with ENG-123" \
  --workflow-ref "release"
```

> **Note:** You'll be prompted to confirm by typing the branch name and environment.

## Security Considerations

### Audit Logging

All production deployments are logged with:

- Deployer's identity
- Timestamp
- Reason provided
- Git commit SHA
- Source and target branches

### Access Control

- Production deployments require explicit AWS production role
- GitHub branch protection prevents direct pushes to main
- Confirmation prompt prevents accidental deployments

### Sensitive Operations

When running Rails commands in production:

### Rails Console

```bash
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Debug customer issue #12345" \
  -- rails console
```

> **Warning:** Rails console in production has full database access. Be extremely careful with any data modifications.

### Database Migrations

```bash
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Run migration for feature ENG-123" \
  -- rails db:migrate
```

Always test migrations in UAT first!

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Deployment workflow not starting

Check:

- GitHub Actions is not experiencing an outage
- Your GitHub token has workflow permissions
- The workflow file exists on the specified `--workflow-ref` branch

### AWS permission denied

Ensure:

```bash
# Re-authenticate
qumis aws login prod

# Verify access
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile qumis_prod
```

### Deployment succeeded but app not working

1. Check Lambda function status
2. Review CloudWatch logs for startup errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Check database connectivity

## Best Practices

1. **Always deploy to UAT first** and wait for verification
2. **Deploy during low-traffic periods** when possible
3. **Monitor for 15-30 minutes** after deployment
4. **Keep deployments small** - easier to debug and rollback
5. **Document your deployment** in the audit log reason
6. **Communicate with the team** before and after deployment

- \[ ] **Migration reversible** or safe to leave
- \[ ] **Tested on production data copy**
- \[ ] **Downtime communicated** if required
- \[ ] **Verification queries** prepared

```bash
# Run migration with careful monitoring
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Run migration for ENG-123" \
  --confirm "prod" \
  -- rails db:migrate:status

# Verify migration succeeded
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Verify migration" \
  --confirm "prod" \
  -- rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables"
```

### Breaking Changes

For deployments with breaking changes:

- \[ ] **API version** incremented
- \[ ] **Deprecation notices** sent to consumers
- \[ ] **Migration guide** published
- \[ ] **Backwards compatibility** maintained (if possible)
- \[ ] **Coordinated deployment** with dependent services

### High-Risk Deployments

For significant changes or high-risk deployments:

- \[ ] **Canary deployment** considered
- \[ ] **Feature flags** in place
- \[ ] **Extended monitoring** period planned
- \[ ] **Rollback rehearsed** in UAT
- \[ ] **War room** scheduled with key stakeholders

# Rollback Procedures

Source: internal/engineering/deployment/rollback-procedures

> **Warning:** **In case of production incident**: Stay calm, follow these procedures systematically, and communicate with the team throughout the process.

## Quick Rollback

If you need to rollback immediately:

```bash
# 1. Get the previous working commit
git log --oneline -10

# 2. Deploy the previous version
qumis deploy api \
  --deploy-branch "main" \
  --env "prod" \
  --reason "ROLLBACK: [Brief description of issue]" \
  --workflow-ref "main" \
  --confirm "prod"
```

## Rollback Decision Tree

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Issue Detected] --> B{Is app running?}
    B -->|No| C[Immediate Rollback]
    B -->|Yes| D{Error rate?}
    D -->|>10%| C
    D -->|<10%| E{Critical feature broken?}
    E -->|Yes| C
    E -->|No| F{Performance degraded?}
    F -->|>50%| G[Consider Rollback]
    F -->|<50%| H[Monitor & Fix Forward]
    C --> I[Execute Rollback]
    G --> J{Can fix quickly?}
    J -->|No| I
    J -->|Yes| H
```

## Step-by-Step Rollback Process

### Step 1: Assess the Situation

### Identify the Issue

Gather information quickly:

```bash
# Check application health
curl -f https://api.qumis.ai/health

# View recent errors
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '10 minutes ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --max-items 20

# Check Lambda function status
aws lambda get-function \
  --function-name qumis-api-prod \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'Configuration.State'
```

### Determine Severity

Classify the issue:

**Critical** (Rollback immediately):

- Application not starting
- Authentication broken
- Data corruption
- > 10% error rate

**High** (Rollback likely):

- Core features broken
- Significant performance degradation
- Database connection issues

**Medium** (Evaluate options):

- Non-critical features affected
- Minor performance impact
- Workaround available

### Communicate Status

Notify the team immediately:

```
🚨 INCIDENT: Production Issue Detected
Service: API
Severity: Critical
Issue: [Brief description]
Action: Initiating rollback
```

Post in:

- \#incidents channel
- \#engineering channel
- Page on-call if critical

### Step 2: Execute Rollback

### Code Rollback

Deploy the last known good version:

```bash
# 1. Find the last working deployment
git log --oneline --grep="Deploy" -10

# 2. Identify the commit SHA
LAST_GOOD_COMMIT="abc123def"  # Replace with actual SHA

# 3. Create rollback branch (optional but recommended)
git checkout -b rollback/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) $LAST_GOOD_COMMIT

# 4. Deploy the rollback
qumis deploy api \
  --deploy-branch "rollback/incident-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)" \
  --env "prod" \
  --reason "ROLLBACK: Critical issue - reverting to $LAST_GOOD_COMMIT" \
  --workflow-ref "main" \
  --confirm "prod"
```

### Database Rollback

For database migration issues:

```bash
# 1. Check migration status
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Check migration status for rollback" \
  --confirm "prod" \
  -- rails db:migrate:status

# 2. Rollback the migration
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "ROLLBACK: Database migration causing issues" \
  --confirm "prod" \
  -- rails db:rollback STEP=1

# 3. Verify rollback succeeded
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Verify migration rollback" \
  --confirm "prod" \
  -- rails db:migrate:status
```

> **Warning:** Database rollbacks can cause data loss. Only rollback migrations that are safe to reverse.

### Configuration Rollback

For environment variable or configuration issues:

```bash
# 1. Revert environment variables in AWS Lambda console
# or via AWS CLI:

aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name qumis-api-prod \
  --environment Variables={KEY1=old_value,KEY2=old_value} \
  --profile qumis_prod

# 2. Wait for update to complete
aws lambda wait function-updated \
  --function-name qumis-api-prod \
  --profile qumis_prod

# 3. Restart the function (triggers new container)
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name qumis-api-prod \
  --payload '{"warmup": true}' \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  /dev/null
```

### Step 3: Verify Rollback

### Monitor Deployment

Watch the rollback deployment:

**GitHub Actions:**

- API Service: [github.com/qumisinc/qumis-api/actions](https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-api/actions)
- Web Service: [github.com/qumisinc/qumis-web/actions](https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-web/actions)

```bash
# Watch CloudWatch logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod --profile qumis_prod --follow
```

### Validate Functionality

Verify the system is working:

```bash
# Health check
curl -f https://api.qumis.ai/health

# Test critical endpoints
curl -f https://api.qumis.ai/api/v1/status

# Check error rates
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '5 minutes ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'events | length(@)'
```

### Update Status

Communicate rollback completion:

```
✅ ROLLBACK COMPLETE
Service: API
Rolled back to: [commit SHA]
Current status: Healthy
Error rate: Normal
Next steps: RCA to follow
```

## Rollback Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Application Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Lambda function failing to initialize, timeout errors

**Actions**:

1. Immediate rollback to previous version
2. Check CloudWatch logs for initialization errors
3. Verify environment variables are correct
4. Check for missing dependencies

### Scenario 2: Database Connection Errors

**Symptoms**: Cannot connect to RDS, connection pool exhausted

**Actions**:

1. Check RDS status and connectivity
2. Verify security groups and network configuration

## Features

### User-Facing (3)

### Report Progress Tracking

Users can now see exactly what's happening while their report generates — a live progress indicator shows each processing phase in real time instead of a generic loading spinner.

- **Live workflow steps** displayed during report generation with status indicators (in-progress, completed, failed)
- **Human-readable phase names** (e.g., "Analyzing documents", "Extracting data", "Generating insights") instead of internal step identifiers
- **Deduplication of consecutive steps** to keep the progress view clean
- **Completion and failure states** with clear visual feedback
- **New WorkflowStep model and API** — the LLM Service reports progress back to the API via `POST /v1/reports/:id/workflow_steps`, enabling real-time frontend updates via polling

**Linear:** [ENG-1517](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1517), [ENG-1518](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1518)

### Field Name Hierarchy in Checklists

Nested checklist fields now display their full parent hierarchy, making it easier to understand where a field sits in complex insurance documents.

- Nested fields show parent names with visual hierarchy indicators (e.g., "Location > Building > Address")
- Clearer visual structure for deeply nested insurance form data
- Improved column alignment and list instance grouping in checklist tables

**Linear:** [ENG-1518](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1518)

### Legal Citations Option for Policy Fact Analysis

Users can now choose whether to include legal citations when generating a Policy Fact Analysis report — the default flow is faster without them, while the full flow adds detailed legal references.

- **Default flow (no legal citations)** skips the legal research steps for faster report generation
- **Optional flow with legal citations** adds detailed legal references for comprehensive analysis
- Report layout and sections remain identical across both flows — the only difference is the inclusion of legal citation data
- Users select the option via a new toggle in the report generation UI

**Linear:** [ENG-1574](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1574)

### Technical (3)

### Docs Authentication via OAuth

Users authenticated with the Qumis app now access docs.qumis.ai seamlessly — no separate login required.

- **OAuth 2.0 flow** with Qumis API as the identity provider, integrated into Mintlify's authentication system
- **Seamless experience** — users already logged into app.qumis.ai are automatically authenticated on docs
- **Group-based access control** — internal engineering docs (like these release notes) are restricted to `@qumis.ai` employees
- Post-login redirect support ensures users return to the exact docs page they were trying to access

**Linear:** [ENG-1531](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1531)

### Feature Flag System

New infrastructure for conditional UI rendering, enabling controlled rollouts of features to specific environments or user groups.

- Beta feature flag system for toggling UI features (billing flow, signup flow) without redeployment
- Flags defined in configuration and checked at render time
- Foundation for gradual rollouts and A/B testing

**Linear:** [ENG-1574](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1574)

### Improved Checklist Detection

The Coverage Table workflow now detects nested lists, repeatable sections, and complex hierarchies in insurance templates much more accurately.

- **Heuristic-based schema detection** — automatically identifies list fields from template patterns like "Location 1", plural names ("Scheduled Locations"), and indented hierarchies
- **Recursive nested list discovery** — handles deeply nested structures (e.g., Location > Building > Coverage) with proper parent-child relationships
- **Pre-distillation for batch inference** — new agents for document distillation and insights before schema detection
- **List preservation in distillation** — ensures numbered/bulleted lists survive the document processing pipeline
- Supports both annotated templates (with `[]` markers) and un-annotated templates (with numbered instances like "Location 1", "Building 1")

**Linear:** [ENG-1484](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1484)

---

## Bug Fixes

### User-Facing (5)

### Chat and Report Scrolling

Fixed vertical scroll not working properly in chat messages and report panels — content would get stuck or jump unexpectedly.

**Linear:** [ENG-1579](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1579)

### Edge Browser Scrolling

Added manual scroll handling for Edge browser where default scroll events were not bubbling correctly on chat, history, and workflow pages.

### Vault Document Preview

Fixed eye icon click in the document vault not opening the preview — caused by PDF.js worker not being configured globally.

**Linear:** [ENG-1536](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1536)

### Seat Management in Admin Portal

Admin portal now shows the seat management UI even when an organization has 0 seats configured — previously the edit controls were hidden entirely.

**Linear:** [PSC-28](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/PSC-28)

### Proposal Generation

Fixed "service unavailable" error when generating proposals.

**Linear:** [ENG-1501](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1501)

### Technical (5)

### Lambda Function Timeouts

Refactored the analysis callback endpoint to return 200 OK immediately and process data asynchronously via Sidekiq. Previously, long-running sync operations (Typesense indexing, ActionCable broadcasts, DB updates) caused the callback sender to time out after 5+ minutes.

**Linear:** [ENG-1493](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1493)

### esbuild Bundling Crash

Removed `@opentelemetry/*` packages from the esbuild external list — they were not available in the Lambda runtime, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` crashes during Lambda cold starts.

**Linear:** [ENG-1581](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1581)

### Report Type Versioning

Fixed handling of different report type versions in the LLM Service to ensure the correct workflow is selected for policy fact analysis with and without legal citations.

**Linear:** [ENG-1574](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1574)

### Search Indexing Memory

Added configurable text truncation for Typesense indexing (via `TRUNCATE_TYPESENSE` env var) to prevent OUT\_OF\_MEMORY errors on large documents.

### Callback Data Serialization

Fixed symbol/string key mismatches in callback data by adding `deep_stringify_keys` before enqueueing to Sidekiq.

---

## Improvements

### User-Facing (3)

### Help Center Link

All links to `help.qumis.ai` now redirect to `docs.qumis.ai` and open in a new tab.

**Linear:** [ENG-1571](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1571)

### Chat Scrollbar UX

Enhanced scrollbar visibility and smooth scrolling behavior in chat panels.

### Report Loading Polish

Improved font weights, spacing, and visual feedback during report generation loading states.

### Technical (3)

### Configurable Credit Charging

Credit usage can be toggled via `CREDIT_USAGE_ENABLED` environment variable, defaulting to disabled for controlled rollout.

### Workflow Benchmarking

New timing and performance tracking for report generation workflow steps, enabling monitoring of processing bottlenecks.

### Large Callback Warnings

API now logs warnings when callback request payloads exceed the 6MB Lambda response limit, helping catch data size issues before they cause failures.

qumis vars list api --env prod
qumis secrets list api --env prod

# Web service - production
qumis vars list web --env prod
qumis secrets list web --env prod
```

> **Note:**&#x20;
>
> - `qumis vars list` shows environment variable names and values from GitHub
> - `qumis secrets list` shows secret names only (values are not accessible for security)
> - Variables and secrets are not directly modified via qumis-cli; use AWS Console or IaC

#### Inspect Running Environment Variables in Production

Use these commands to inspect the actual environment variables running in production containers:

```bash
# API service
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Print ENV vars" \
  --confirm "prod" \
  -- env | grep -E "^[A-Z_]+=.*" | sort

# Web service
qumis services exec web \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Print ENV vars" \
  --confirm "prod" \
  -- env | grep -E "^[A-Z_]+=.*" | sort
```

**Command breakdown:**

- `qumis services exec [service]` - Execute command in service container
- `--env prod` - Target production environment
- `--reason "..."` - Audit trail reason (required for prod)
- `--confirm "prod"` - Production safety confirmation
- `-- env` - Run env command inside container
- `grep -E "^[A-Z_]+=.*"` - Filter for uppercase environment variables
- `sort` - Alphabetically sort output for easier reading

```

### Repository Tools

```bash
# Pack repository for AI tools
qumis pack --output context.xml

# Copy to clipboard (macOS)
qumis pack --stdout | pbcopy
```

## Service-Specific Commands

### API Service

```bash
# Rails-specific commands
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails generate model User
qumis services exec api --env dev -- bundle install
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rake db:create
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rspec
```

### Web Service

```bash
# Node.js/Next.js commands
qumis services exec web --env dev -- npm install
qumis services exec web --env dev -- npm run build
qumis services exec web --env dev -- npm test
```

### LLM Service

```bash
# Python/ML commands
qumis services exec llm --env dev -- python manage.py
qumis services exec llm --env dev -- pip list
```

### Report Operations

Download documents from a Qumis report into a zip file.

```bash Download from Local
qumis reports documents <report_id>
```

```bash Download from Production
qumis reports documents <report_id> --env prod
```

```bash Download to Specific Directory
qumis reports documents <report_id> --output ~/Downloads
```

```bash Force Download (Stuck Reports)
qumis reports documents <report_id> --env prod --force
```

**Flags:**

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--env` | `-e` | `local` | Environment to use (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `uat`, `prod`) |
| `--output` | `-o` | `.` | Output directory for the zip file |
| `--force` | `-f` | `false` | Download even if report is still processing |

> **Note:** The `--force` flag is useful when a report is stuck in a processing state. However, documents may not be available until the report processing completes.

**Example Output:**

```
• Fetching report abc-123-def...
• Found 5 documents
  -> policy-document.pdf (2.1 MB)
  -> endorsement-1.pdf (450 KB)
  -> endorsement-2.pdf (380 KB)
  -> schedule.xlsx (125 KB)
  -> certificate.pdf (89 KB)
✓ Downloaded 5/5 documents to ./abc-123-def.zip (3.1 MB)

Zip file saved to: ./abc-123-def.zip
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide clear reasons** for production operations
2. **Test in dev/UAT first** before production deployments
3. **Use ticket numbers** in deployment reasons for traceability
4. **Run `qumis sync`** before starting new work
5. **Check `qumis status`** to see current branch and PR status
6. **Use `qumis doctor`** to diagnose configuration issues

## Scripting with qumis-cli

### Deployment Script Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-to-uat.sh

set -e

echo "Deploying to UAT..."

# Ensure we're on the right branch
git checkout release

# Sync with remote
qumis sync

# Deploy to UAT (or production)
qumis deploy api \
  --env uat \
  --reason "UAT deployment for sprint review" \
  --deploy-branch "release" \
  --workflow-ref "release"

# Note: For production, you'll be prompted to confirm by typing:
# - The deploy branch (e.g., "release")
# - The environment ("prod")

# Verify deployment
qumis services info api --env uat

echo "UAT deployment complete!"
```

### Health Check Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# health-check.sh

ENVIRONMENTS=("dev" "qa" "uat" "prod")

for ENV in "${ENVIRONMENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Checking $ENV..."
  qumis services info api --env $ENV || echo "$ENV is down!"
done
```

# Rollback specific number of migrations
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails db:rollback STEP=2

# Production rollback (use with extreme caution)
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "ROLLBACK: Migration causing issues" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails db:rollback
```

### Rails Runner

Execute Ruby code in the Rails environment:

```bash
# Simple commands
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "puts User.count"

# Complex scripts
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "User.where(created_at: 1.day.ago..Time.now).count"

# Production queries
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Get metrics for daily report" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "puts User.active.count"
```

### Database Tasks

### Development Only

# Check pending migrations
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.migration_context.needs_migration?"
```

## Data Queries and Manipulation

### Safe Read Operations

```bash Count Records
qumis services exec api --env prod \
  --reason "Get user metrics" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "puts User.count"
```

```bash Find Specific Records
qumis services exec api --env prod \
  --reason "Check specific user status" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "puts User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')&.attributes"
```

```bash Generate Reports
qumis services exec api --env prod \
  --reason "Generate usage report" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "
    puts 'Daily Active Users: ' + User.where(last_sign_in_at: 1.day.ago..Time.now).count.to_s
  "
```

### Data Modifications

> **Warning:** **DANGER**: Data modifications in production should be:
>
> - Tested in UAT first
> - Approved by team lead
> - Wrapped in transactions when possible
> - Backed up before execution

```bash
# UAT testing first
qumis services exec api --env uat -- rails runner "
  User.find_by(email: 'test@example.com')&.update(status: 'active')
"

# Production update (with extreme caution)
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Fix user status per support ticket #789" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "
    ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
      user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
      if user
        user.update!(status: 'active')
        puts 'Updated user ' + user.id.to_s
      else
        puts 'User not found'
        raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
      end
    end
  "
```

## Rake Tasks

```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Check Application State

```bash
# Rails environment
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "puts Rails.env"

# Database connection
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.active?"

# Loaded gems
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "puts Gem.loaded_specs.keys.sort"

# Environment variables
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "puts ENV.select { |k,v| k.start_with?('RAILS_') }"
```

### Performance Analysis

```bash
# Database query analysis
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "
  ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
  User.includes(:posts).where(active: true).limit(10).each { |u| u.posts.count }
"

# Memory usage
qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "
  puts 'Memory: ' + (`ps -o rss= -p \#{Process.pid}`.to_i / 1024).to_s + ' MB'
"
```

## Best Practices

### Safety Guidelines

1. **Always test in development first**
   ```bash
   # Test in dev
   qumis services exec api --env dev -- rails runner "YOUR_COMMAND"
   # Then in UAT
   qumis services exec api --env uat -- rails runner "YOUR_COMMAND"
   # Finally in production
   qumis services exec api --env prod --reason "Tested in UAT" --confirm prod -- rails runner "YOUR_COMMAND"
   ```

2. **Use transactions for data modifications**
   ```ruby
   ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
     # Your changes here
     # Will rollback if any error occurs
   end
   ```

3. **Use sandbox mode for exploration**
   ```bash
   qumis services exec api --env prod --reason "Safe exploration" --confirm prod -- rails console --sandbox
   ```

### Audit Log Best Practices

Good reason examples:

- ✅ "Debug customer issue #12345"
- ✅ "Apply migration for feature ENG-789"
- ✅ "Generate monthly usage report for finance"
- ✅ "Fix data inconsistency per bug report #456"

Bad reason examples:

- ❌ "Testing"
- ❌ "Fix stuff"
- ❌ "Running command"

### Performance Considerations

1. **Avoid N+1 queries**
   ```ruby
   # Bad
   User.all.each { |u| puts u.posts.count }

   # Good
   User.includes(:posts).each { |u| puts u.posts.count }
   ```

2. **Use batch processing for large datasets**
   ```ruby
   User.find_each(batch_size: 1000) do |user|
     # Process user
   end
   ```

3. **Add timeouts for long-running operations**
   ```ruby
   Timeout::timeout(300) do
     # Operation that shouldn't take more than 5 minutes
   end
   ```

## Common Patterns

### Daily Operations Check

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily-check.sh

echo "Checking API health across environments..."

for ENV in dev qa uat prod; do
  echo "Environment: $ENV"

  if [ "$ENV" = "prod" ]; then
    qumis services exec api \
      --env prod \
      --reason "Daily health check" \
      --confirm prod \
      -- rails runner "puts 'DB Connected: ' + ActiveRecord::Base.connection.active?.to_s"
  else
    qumis services exec api --env $ENV -- rails runner "puts 'DB Connected: ' + ActiveRecord::Base.connection.active?.to_s"
  fi
done
```

### Data Export Script

```bash
# Export user data for analysis
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Export data for monthly analytics" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "
    require 'csv'
    CSV.open('/tmp/users_export.csv', 'w') do |csv|
      csv << ['ID', 'Email', 'Created At', 'Status']
      User.find_each do |user|
        csv << [user.id, user.email, user.created_at, user.status]
      end
    end
    puts 'Export complete: /tmp/users_export.csv'
  "
```

## Troubleshooting

### Command times out

Long-running commands may timeout. Consider:

- Running in background with nohup
- Breaking into smaller batches
- Using rake tasks instead of runner

### Memory errors

For memory-intensive operations:

- Process in batches
- Use `find_each` instead of `all`
- Clear cache between operations

### Permission denied

Ensure you have:

- Proper AWS credentials
- Access to the environment
- Required permissions in qumis-cli

# Visual Regression Testing

Source: internal/engineering/operations/visual-regression-testing

Playwright + Chromatic visual regression tests detect UI changes across builds using automated browser testing and visual diffing.

> **Info:** **For comprehensive documentation** including viewport strategy, architecture details, and test structure, see the [qumis-web README](https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-web/blob/main/README.md).

## Quick Start

### Install Playwright Browsers

```bash
pnpm playwright:install
```

Installs Chromium and dependencies needed to run tests.

### Set Chromatic Project Token

Set your Chromatic project token as an environment variable:

```bash
export CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN=chpt_your_token_here
```

Or add to your `.env` file (recommended):

```bash
CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN=chpt_your_token_here
```

### Run Tests Locally

Test without Chromatic integration:

```bash
pnpm playwright:test
```

### Run Chromatic Visual Regression

Upload screenshots to Chromatic for visual diffing:

```bash
pnpm chromatic
```

## Common Commands

### Local Development

```bash Run all tests locally
pnpm playwright:test
```

```bash Run tests in UI mode (debugging)
pnpm playwright:ui
```

```bash Run specific test file
pnpm playwright:test chromatic-visual.spec.ts
```

### Chromatic Integration

```bash Upload to Chromatic (uses .env token)
pnpm chromatic
```

```bash Upload with explicit token
pnpm exec chromatic --playwright --project-token=chpt_your_token_here
```

## CI/CD Workflow

### Automatic Triggers

The Chromatic workflow runs automatically on:

- Push to `main` or `release` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `release` branches
- Manual workflow dispatch

### Manual Trigger via GitHub CLI

```bash Trigger on Current Branch
gh workflow run chromatic.yml --ref "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
```

```bash Force Rebuild (Skip Cache)
gh workflow run chromatic.yml \
  --ref "$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)" \
  --field force_rebuild=true
```

```bash Watch Workflow Status
gh run watch
```

### Manual Trigger via GitHub UI

### Navigate to Workflow

Go to **Actions** → **Chromatic** workflow → **Run workflow**

### Select Branch

Select your branch from the dropdown

### Configure Options

Optionally check **Force Chromatic to rebuild** to skip cache

### Run Workflow

Click **Run workflow** to start the build

## Test Configuration

### Default Viewport Coverage

By default, tests run on **TIER1 + TIER2 viewports** (7 total):

- **TIER1** (4 viewports): Primary business workflows - desktop Full HD, laptops, windowed displays
- **TIER2** (3 viewports): Extended desktop coverage - QHD, ultrawide, legacy laptops

See `playwright.config.ts` in qumis-web for active configuration.

### Performance Considerations

- **TIER1 only** (4 viewports): ~2-4 minutes per test suite
- **TIER1 + TIER2** (7 viewports): ~4-7 minutes per test suite
- **All tiers** (11 viewports): ~7-12 minutes per test suite

> **Tip:** For PR builds, consider using TIER1 only for fast feedback. Use TIER1 + TIER2 for main/release branches.

## Troubleshooting

### Tests failing locally but passing in CI

- Ensure you're using the same Node/pnpm versions as CI
- Run `pnpm playwright:install` to update browser binaries
- Clear Playwright cache: `rm -rf ~/.cache/ms-playwright`

### Chromatic token not found

- Verify `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` is set in your environment
- Check your `.env` file in the qumis-web root directory
- Get token from Chromatic project settings

### Visual diffs showing unexpected changes

- Review changes in Chromatic dashboard
- Check if viewport configuration changed
- Verify CSS/component changes are intentional
- Accept baseline if changes are expected

> **Warning:** **Production token required**: The `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` secret must be set in GitHub repository settings for CI/CD workflows to run.

> **Warning:** Direct access to Shared Services is restricted to DevOps team members. Most engineers interact with it indirectly through CI/CD pipelines.

## Access Management

### AWS SSO Configuration

### Access AWS Console

**Primary Method**: Use the AWS SSO Portal to access the AWS Console for any environment:

[**https://qumis.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts**](https://qumis.awsapps.com/start/#/?tab=accounts)

This portal provides direct browser access to all AWS accounts you have permissions for.

### Configure SSO Profile

For CLI access, configure your `~/.aws/config` file with the appropriate SSO profiles.

> **Info:** See the complete AWS configuration template in [Tools Setup → AWS Configuration](/internal/engineering/tools-setup#aws-configuration).
>
> The configuration includes all environment profiles (dev, qa, uat, prod, sharedservices) using:
>
> - SSO URL: `https://qumis.awsapps.com/start/`
> - Region: `us-east-2`

### Login to Environment

```bash
# Using qumis-cli
qumis aws login dev

# Or directly with AWS CLI
aws sso login --profile qumis_dev
```

### Verify Access

```bash
# Check current identity
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile qumis_dev

# List S3 buckets
aws s3 ls --profile qumis_dev
```

### Permission Levels

| Role | Dev | QA | UAT | Prod | Shared Services |
|------|-----|----|----|------|-----------------|
| Junior Engineer | Full | Full | Read | No | No |
| Engineer | Full | Full | Full | Read | No |
| Senior Engineer | Full | Full | Full | Full | Read |
| DevOps | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full |
| Team Lead | Full | Full | Full | Full | Full |

## Service Architecture

### Lambda Functions

Each environment runs Lambda functions for our services:

```
qumis-api-{environment}
qumis-web-{environment}
qumis-llm-{environment}
```

View functions:

```bash
# List all Lambda functions
qumis lambda list-functions --env dev
qumis lambda list-functions --env prod

# Get function details
qumis lambda describe-function qumis-api --env dev
```

### RDS Databases

- **Dev**: Single instance, minimal resources
- **QA**: Single instance, production-like config
- **UAT**: Multi-AZ for testing failover
- **Production**: Multi-AZ with read replicas

### S3 Buckets

Naming convention: `qumis-{service}-{environment}-{region}`

Examples:

- `qumis-api-dev-us-east-1`
- `qumis-api-prod-us-east-1`
- `qumis-uploads-prod-us-east-1`

## Monitoring by Environment

### CloudWatch Log Groups

Log group naming: `/aws/lambda/qumis-{service}-{environment}`

```bash
# View logs for different environments
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/qumis-api-dev --profile qumis_dev
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod --profile qumis_prod --follow
```

### Metrics and Alarms

- **Dev**: Basic metrics, no alarms
- **QA**: Standard metrics, test alarms
- **UAT**: Full metrics, staging alarms
- **Production**: Comprehensive metrics, critical alarms with PagerDuty integration

## Cost Management

### Environment Costs (Monthly Estimates)

| Environment | Typical Cost | Cost Controls |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Dev | $500-800 | Auto-shutdown, smaller instances |
| QA | $800-1200 | Scheduled scaling, cleanup jobs |
| UAT | $1500-2000 | On-demand scaling |
| Production | $5000-8000 | Reserved instances, Savings Plans |
| Shared Services | $300-500 | Minimal resources |

### Cost Optimization

**Development**:

- Auto-stop Lambda functions after hours
- Use spot instances where possible
- Regular cleanup of old resources

**Production**:

- Reserved instances for predictable workloads
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Regular cost analysis and optimization

## Security Considerations

### Network Isolation

- Each environment has its own VPC
- No direct connectivity between environments
- Bastion hosts for emergency access
- VPN access for production (when required)

### Data Protection

- **Dev/QA**: Synthetic test data only
- **UAT**: Sanitized production data
- **Production**: Full encryption at rest and in transit
- **Backups**: Daily snapshots, 30-day retention

### Compliance

- SOC 2 compliance for production
- HIPAA compliance where applicable
- Regular security audits
- Penetration testing quarterly

## Emergency Procedures

### Environment Down

### Check AWS Status

Visit https://status.aws.amazon.com/ to check for AWS service outages

### Verify Access

Authenticate to the affected environment:

```bash
qumis aws login {env}
```

### Check Key Services

Verify Lambda, RDS, and S3 are operational:

```bash Lambda
qumis lambda list-functions --env {env}
```

```bash RDS
aws rds describe-db-instances --profile qumis_{env}
```

```bash S3
aws s3 ls --profile qumis_{env}
```

### Escalate if Needed

Contact DevOps team if services are down or unresponsive

### Cross-Environment Issues

If issues span multiple environments:

### Check Shared Services First

Verify the Shared Services account is operational as it supports all environments

### Verify CI/CD Pipeline Status

Check GitHub Actions and deployment pipeline health

### Check DNS and Certificates

Verify Route53 and ACM configurations are working correctly

### Review Recent Infrastructure Changes

Check CloudTrail for recent changes that may have affected multiple environments

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Progression**: Always deploy dev → qa → uat → prod
2. **Access Principle**: Use minimum required permissions
3. **Cost Awareness**: Clean up unused resources regularly
4. **Security First**: Never copy production data to lower environments without sanitization
5. **Documentation**: Document any manual changes made to environments

## Metrics Monitoring

### Lambda Metrics

### Access Metrics

1. Navigate to CloudWatch → Metrics
2. Select "Lambda" namespace
3. Choose metric dimension (By Function Name)
4. Select your function (e.g., `qumis-api-prod`)

### Key Metrics

- **Invocations**: Number of function executions
- **Errors**: Number of failed executions
- **Duration**: Execution time
- **Throttles**: Rate-limited invocations
- **Concurrent Executions**: Parallel executions

### Create Dashboard

```bash
# Get metrics via CLI
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/Lambda \
  --metric-name Duration \
  --dimensions Name=FunctionName,Value=qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' --iso-8601) \
  --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
  --period 300 \
  --statistics Average,Maximum \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Custom Metrics

Our application logs custom metrics:

```bash
# Application performance
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace Qumis/API \
  --metric-name ResponseTime \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' --iso-8601) \
  --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
  --period 300 \
  --statistics Average \
  --profile qumis_prod

# Business metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace Qumis/Business \
  --metric-name ActiveUsers \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '24 hours ago' --iso-8601) \
  --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Sum \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

## Real-time Monitoring

### Live Tail

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# live-monitor.sh

LOG_GROUP="/aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod"
PROFILE="qumis_prod"

echo "Monitoring $LOG_GROUP..."

# Color codes for different log levels
aws logs tail $LOG_GROUP \
  --profile $PROFILE \
  --follow \
  --format short \
  --filter-pattern "" | while read line; do
    if [[ $line == *"ERROR"* ]]; then
      echo -e "\033[31m$line\033[0m"  # Red for errors
    elif [[ $line == *"WARN"* ]]; then
      echo -e "\033[33m$line\033[0m"  # Yellow for warnings
    else
      echo "$line"
    fi
done
```

### Multi-Environment Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# monitor-all-envs.sh

ENVIRONMENTS=("dev" "qa" "uat" "prod")
SEARCH_PATTERN="ERROR"

for ENV in "${ENVIRONMENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "=== Checking $ENV environment ==="

  LOG_GROUP="/aws/lambda/qumis-api-$ENV"
  PROFILE="qumis_$ENV"

  ERROR_COUNT=$(aws logs filter-log-events \
    --log-group-name $LOG_GROUP \
    --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' '+%s')000 \
    --filter-pattern "$SEARCH_PATTERN" \
    --profile $PROFILE \
    --query 'events | length(@)' \
    --output text)

  echo "$ENV: $ERROR_COUNT errors in last hour"
done
```

## Log Export and Analysis

### Export to S3

```bash
# Export logs to S3 for analysis
aws logs create-export-task \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --from $(date -u -d '7 days ago' '+%s')000 \
  --to $(date -u '+%s')000 \
  --destination qumis-logs-export \
  --destination-prefix production/$(date +%Y/%m/%d) \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Download for Local Analysis

```bash
# Download recent logs
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' '+%s')000 \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --output json > logs_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json

# Parse with jq
cat logs_*.json | jq '.events[].message' | grep ERROR
```

## Troubleshooting Patterns

### Debugging Production Issues

### Identify Error Pattern

```bash
# Get error summary
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '30 minutes ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'events[].message' \
  --output text | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Find Related Logs

```bash
# Get request ID from error
REQUEST_ID="abc-123-def"

# Find all logs for that request
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --filter-pattern "\"$REQUEST_ID\"" \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Check Metrics

```bash
# Check error rate
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/Lambda \
  --metric-name Errors \
  --dimensions Name=FunctionName,Value=qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' --iso-8601) \
  --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
  --period 60 \
  --statistics Sum \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Common Issues

### No logs appearing

Check:

- Lambda function is actually running
- Correct log group name
- IAM permissions for CloudWatch
- Time range is correct

### Logs delayed

- CloudWatch has inherent delay (few seconds)
- Use `--follow` flag for real-time
- Check Lambda function isn't buffering logs

### Can't find specific error

- Use broader search pattern
- Check different time ranges
- Error might be in different log group
- Try CloudWatch Insights for complex queries

## Best Practices

### Log Hygiene

1. **Structured Logging**: Use JSON format for easier parsing
2. **Log Levels**: Use appropriate levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
3. **Correlation IDs**: Include request IDs for tracing
4. **Sensitive Data**: Never log passwords, tokens, or PII
5. **Performance**: Don't log in tight loops

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Set up dashboards** for key metrics
2. **Create saved queries** for common investigations
3. **Export critical logs** for compliance
4. **Regular review** of error patterns
5. **Automate alerts** for critical issues

### Cost Management

1. **Set retention periods** appropriately:
   - Dev: 7 days
   - QA: 14 days
   - UAT: 30 days
   - Production: 90 days

2. **Use log filters** to reduce storage:
   ```bash
   # Only store errors and warnings in long-term storage
   aws logs put-retention-policy \
     --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-dev \
     --retention-in-days 7 \
     --profile qumis_dev
   ```

## Alert Response Procedures

### Alert Severity Levels

| Level | Response Time | Action Required | Examples |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate | Page on-call, immediate investigation | Service down, data loss |
| **High** | 15 minutes | Alert team, investigate soon | High error rate, performance degradation |
| **Medium** | 1 hour | Review and plan fix | Increased latency, warning thresholds |
| **Low** | Next business day | Monitor and track | Minor issues, trending concerns |

### Response Playbook

### Acknowledge Alert

1. Respond in PagerDuty (if paged)
2. Post in #incidents channel
3. Start incident timer

### Initial Assessment

```bash
# Check service health
curl -f https://api.qumis.ai/health

# Check recent errors
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '10 minutes ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --max-items 20
```

### Investigate Root Cause

- Review CloudWatch logs
- Check recent deployments
- Verify external dependencies
- Review database status

### Take Action

- Apply immediate fix
- Rollback if necessary
- Scale resources if needed
- Contact relevant teams

### Document Resolution

- Update incident ticket
- Post resolution in Slack
- Schedule RCA if needed

## Managing Alert Fatigue

### Alert Tuning

```bash View Alarm History
aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history \
  --alarm-name qumis-api-prod-high-error-rate \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --max-records 50
```

```bash Check Alarm State Changes
aws cloudwatch describe-alarms \
  --alarm-names qumis-api-prod-high-error-rate \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'MetricAlarms[0].StateTransitionReason'
```

### Best Practices

1. **Avoid noise**: Set appropriate thresholds based on historical data
2. **Use composite alarms**: Combine related metrics for better accuracy
3. **Implement delays**: Use evaluation periods to avoid transient spikes
4. **Regular review**: Monthly review of alarm effectiveness
5. **Document context**: Include runbook links in alarm descriptions

# Debugging Production

Source: internal/engineering/troubleshooting/debugging-production

> **Warning:** **Production debugging requires extreme caution**. Always:
>
> - Get approval for production access
> - Use read-only operations when possible
> - Document all actions taken
> - Have a rollback plan ready

## Production Debugging Principles

### Safety First

> **Note:** Follow these critical safety principles when debugging production:
>
> 1. **Read-only by default** - Start with non-destructive operations
> 2. **Audit everything** - All commands are logged with reasons
> 3. **Test in UAT first** - Reproduce issues in UAT when possible
> 4. **Pair debugging** - Have another engineer review critical operations
> 5. **Time-box investigations** - Set limits to prevent extended downtime

## Initial Assessment

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# 1. Check service status
curl -f https://api.qumis.ai/health || echo "Service unhealthy"

# 2. Check ECS service status (blue cluster)
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster blue-prod \
  --services api web sidekiq \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'services[*].[serviceName,status,runningCount,desiredCount]' \
  --output table

# 3. Check recent errors across all ECS services (last 15 minutes)
for SERVICE in api web sidekiq; do
  echo "=== $SERVICE errors ==="
  aws logs filter-log-events \
    --log-group-name ecs/blue/prod/$SERVICE \
    --start-time $(date -u -d '15 minutes ago' '+%s')000 \
    --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
    --profile qumis_prod \
    --max-items 10
done

# 4. Check ECS cluster metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/ECS \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=ServiceName,Value=api Name=ClusterName,Value=blue-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' --iso-8601) \
  --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
  --period 300 \
  --statistics Average,Maximum \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Incident Timeline

### Establish Timeline

```bash
# Find when issues started
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '2 hours ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'events[0].timestamp' \
  --output text | xargs -I {} date -d @{}
```

### Check Recent Changes

```bash
# Recent deployments
git log --oneline --grep="Deploy to prod" -5

# Check GitHub Actions
gh run list --workflow deploy.yml --limit 5

# Infrastructure changes
aws cloudtrail lookup-events \
  --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=UpdateFunctionConfiguration \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --max-items 10
```

### Correlate Events

Match error timing with:

- Deployment times
- Configuration changes
- Traffic spikes
- External service issues

## Safe Debugging Techniques

### Read-Only Console Access

```bash
# Use sandbox mode for safety
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Debug issue #12345 - READ ONLY" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails console --sandbox

# In console:
> User.count  # Safe read
> User.where(created_at: 1.hour.ago..Time.now).count
> # Any changes will be rolled back on exit
```

### Query Specific Data

```bash
# Run specific queries without console
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Check user status for support ticket #789" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "
    user = User.find_by(email: 'user@example.com')
    if user
      puts 'User found:'
      puts '  ID: ' + user.id.to_s
      puts '  Status: ' + user.status
      puts '  Created: ' + user.created_at.to_s
      puts '  Last login: ' + user.last_sign_in_at.to_s
    else
      puts 'User not found'
    end
  "
```

### Trace Request Flow

```bash
# Find specific request in logs
REQUEST_ID="abc-123-def-456"

# Get all logs for request
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --filter-pattern "\"$REQUEST_ID\"" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'events[*].message' \
  --output text

# Follow request through services
for SERVICE in api web llm; do
  echo "=== $SERVICE ==="
  aws logs filter-log-events \
    --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-$SERVICE-prod \
    --filter-pattern "\"$REQUEST_ID\"" \
    --profile qumis_prod \
    --max-items 10
done
```

## Common Production Issues

### High Error Rate

### Diagnosis

```bash
# Get error breakdown
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '30 minutes ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'events[*].message' \
  --output text | \
  grep -oE "([A-Za-z]+Error|[A-Za-z]+Exception)" | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Check for pattern
aws logs insights start-query \
  --log-group-names /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' '+%s') \
  --end-time $(date -u '+%s') \
  --query-string '
    fields @timestamp, @message
    | filter @message like /ERROR/
    | stats count() by bin(5m)
  ' \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Common Causes

**Database Issues**:

```bash
# Check database connectivity
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Check DB connection" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection.active?"

# Check connection pool
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Check connection pool" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "puts ActiveRecord::Base.connection_pool.stat"
```

**External Service Issues**:

```bash
# Test external APIs
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Test external service connectivity" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "
    require 'net/http'
    uri = URI('https://external-api.example.com/health')
    response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)
    puts 'External API Status: ' + response.code
  "
```

### Performance Degradation

### Identify Bottlenecks

```bash
# Check Lambda duration
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/Lambda \
  --metric-name Duration \
  --dimensions Name=FunctionName,Value=qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '2 hours ago' --iso-8601) \
  --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
  --period 300 \
  --statistics Average,Maximum,Minimum \
  --profile qumis_prod

# Find slow endpoints
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --filter-pattern "[SLOW]" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'events[*].message' \
  --output text | \
  grep -oE "POST|GET|PUT|DELETE [^ ]+" | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Database Performance

```bash
# Check for slow queries
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Identify slow queries" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "
    ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
    ActiveRecord::Base.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG

    # Run suspected slow query with timing
    start = Time.now
    User.includes(:posts, :comments).where(active: true).limit(100).to_a
    puts 'Query time: ' + (Time.now - start).to_s + ' seconds'
  "

# Check for missing indexes
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Check indexes" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails runner "
    ActiveRecord::Base.connection.tables.each do |table|
      indexes = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.indexes(table)
      puts table + ': ' + indexes.map(&:name).join(', ')
    end
  "
```

### Memory Issues

```bash
# Check memory usage patterns
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --filter-pattern "REPORT" \
  --profile qumis_prod \

    GC.start
    puts 'After GC: ' + (\`ps -o rss= -p \#{Process.pid}\`.to_i / 1024).to_s + ' MB'
  "
```

### Data Inconsistencies

> **Warning:** Be extremely careful when investigating data issues. Never modify production data without approval and backups.

```bash
# Investigate data issue (READ ONLY)
qumis services exec api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "Investigate data inconsistency - ticket #456" \
  --confirm prod \
  -- rails console --sandbox

# In console:
> # Find problematic records
> problematic = User.left_joins(:profile).where(profiles: {id: nil})
> puts "Found #{problematic.count} users without profiles"
>
> # Analyze pattern
> problematic.limit(5).each do |user|
>   puts "User #{user.id}: created #{user.created_at}, status: #{user.status}"
> end
>
> # DO NOT FIX IN PRODUCTION - Create fix script for review
```

## Advanced Debugging Tools

### CloudWatch Insights

```sql
-- Find specific error patterns
fields @timestamp, @message, @requestId
| filter @message like /ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20

-- Analyze request patterns
fields @timestamp, @requestId, @duration
| filter @type = "REPORT"
| stats avg(@duration) as avg_duration,
        max(@duration) as max_duration,
        count() as request_count
by bin(5m)

-- Find memory issues
fields @timestamp, @maxMemoryUsed, @memorySize
| filter @type = "REPORT"
| filter @maxMemoryUsed / @memorySize > 0.9
| sort @timestamp desc
```

### X-Ray Tracing

```bash
# Get trace summaries
aws xray get-trace-summaries \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' --iso-8601) \
  --end-time $(date -u --iso-8601) \
  --filter-expression "service(\"qumis-api-prod\") AND error" \
  --profile qumis_prod

# Get detailed trace
aws xray get-traces \
  --trace-ids "1-5f4d6e7c-1234567890abcdef" \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

### Custom Debug Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# production-debug.sh

set -e

REASON="$1"
if [ -z "$REASON" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 'reason for debugging'"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Starting production debug session..."
echo "Reason: $REASON"

# Create debug report
REPORT="debug_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt"

echo "=== Production Debug Report ===" > $REPORT
echo "Date: $(date)" >> $REPORT
echo "Reason: $REASON" >> $REPORT
echo "" >> $REPORT

# Collect metrics
echo "=== Error Count (Last Hour) ===" >> $REPORT
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' '+%s')000 \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR" \
  --profile qumis_prod \
  --query 'length(events)' \
  --output text >> $REPORT

# Add more debug commands as needed

echo "Debug report saved to $REPORT"
```

## Production Fix Workflow

### Emergency Fixes

### Identify Root Cause

Use read-only debugging to understand the issue

### Develop Fix

Create fix in development environment and test thoroughly

### Test in UAT

```bash
# Deploy to UAT
qumis deploy api --env uat --reason "Test fix for production issue"

# Verify fix
qumis services exec api --env uat -- rails runner "# test script"
```

### Deploy to Production

```bash
# Deploy fix
qumis deploy api \
  --env prod \
  --reason "HOTFIX: Issue #123 - [description]" \
  --confirm prod

# Monitor closely
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/qumis-api-prod --profile qumis_prod --follow
```

### Verify Resolution

Confirm issue is resolved and no new issues introduced

## Post-Incident Actions

### Documentation

> **Info:** Create incident report with:
>
> - Timeline of events
> - Root cause analysis
> - Actions taken
> - Lessons learned
> - Prevention measures

### Monitoring Improvements

```bash
# Add new alarm for detected issue
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name "qumis-api-prod-[specific-issue]" \
  --alarm-description "Alert for [issue description]" \
  --metric-name Errors \
  --namespace AWS/Lambda \
  --statistic Sum \
  --period 300 \
  --threshold 5 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
  --dimensions Name=FunctionName,Value=qumis-api-prod \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:729033428609:prod-alerts \
  --profile qumis_prod
```

## Best Practices

> **Tip:** Follow these best practices for safe production debugging:

# Development

Source: development

> **Info:** **Prerequisites**:
>
> - Node.js version 19 or higher
> - A docs repository with a `docs.json` file

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system.

### Install the Mintlify CLI

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

### Preview locally

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime

This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`

### Issue: Encountering an unknown error

Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.

# Creating Custom Templates

Source: guides/creating-custom-templates

# Creating Custom Templates

Custom templates in Qumis help you standardize document creation and streamline workflows for your organization. This guide will walk you through creating, managing, and using custom templates.

## Understanding Templates

Templates in Qumis are pre-formatted documents that serve as starting points for common insurance documents such as:

- Policy documents
- Claims forms
- Risk assessment reports
- Compliance checklists
- Client correspondence

## Creating Your First Template

### Access Template Builder

Navigate to **Tools** → **Template Builder** from the main dashboard.

### Choose Template Type

Select the type of template you want to create:

- Document Template
- Email Template
- Report Template
- Form Template

### Design Your Template

Use the visual editor to:

- Add text fields and placeholders
- Insert dynamic variables (e.g., `{{client_name}}`, `{{policy_number}}`)
- Format sections with headers and styles
- Add conditional logic for dynamic content

### Save and Test

- Name your template descriptively
- Add tags for easy discovery
- Test with sample data to ensure proper formatting

## Template Variables

Templates support dynamic variables that automatically populate with relevant data:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{client_name}}` | Client's full name | John Smith |
| `{{policy_number}}` | Policy identification number | POL-2024-001234 |
| `{{effective_date}}` | Policy effective date | January 1, 2024 |
| `{{coverage_amount}}` | Total coverage amount | $1,000,000 |
| `{{agent_name}}` | Assigned agent name | Sarah Johnson |

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

Add conditional sections that appear based on specific criteria:

```handlebars
{{#if coverage_type == "comprehensive"}}
  This policy includes comprehensive coverage with...
{{/if}}
```

### Calculated Fields

Include calculations in your templates:

```handlebars
Premium Total: {{monthly_premium * 12}}
```

### Nested Templates

Embed one template within another for modular document creation:

```handlebars
{{include "standard_terms_template"}}
```

## Managing Templates

### Organizing Templates

- Use folders to organize templates by department or document type
- Apply tags for quick filtering and search
- Set permissions to control who can edit or use templates

### Version Control

Qumis automatically maintains version history for all templates:

View previous versions

Compare changes between versions

Restore earlier versions if needed

Track who made changes and when

### Sharing Templates

Templates can be shared across your organization:

### Team Sharing

Share with specific teams or departments with customizable permissions

### Organization-Wide

Make templates available to all users in your organization

### External Sharing

Export templates for use with partners or other systems

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include version numbers or dates for frequently updated templates
- Prefix with department codes (e.g., "CLAIMS\_Initial\_Report")

### Testing

- Always test templates with various data scenarios
- Verify all variables populate correctly
- Check formatting across different export formats (PDF, Word, etc.)

### Maintenance

- Review templates quarterly for accuracy
- Update for regulatory changes
- Archive outdated templates rather than deleting

## Common Use Cases

Create standardized policy documents that automatically populate with client and coverage information.

Design claim forms that include all required fields and automatically calculate totals.

Build email templates for common communications like renewals, updates, and notifications.

## Troubleshooting

> **Warning:** If variables are not populating correctly, ensure:
>
> - Variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)
> - Data sources are properly connected
> - Required fields are present in the source data

# Policy Comparison Guide

Source: guides/policy-comparison

## Getting Started with Qumis Coverage Table

**Welcome to the Qumis Coverage Table feature!** - your powerful tool for comparing insurance policies with attorney-level precision. This guide will walk you through creating your first coverage comparison table, helping you unlock strategic insights that go beyond basic policy differences.

## Overview: What is the Coverage Table?

The Coverage Table is an AI-powered comparison tool that allows you to analyze multiple insurance policies side-by-side. Whether you're evaluating quotes, comparing renewal options, or assessing coverage gaps, this feature transforms complex policy analysis into clear, actionable insights.

### Navigate to Coverage Table

From your Qumis dashboard, locate the **Coverage Table (BETA)** option in the left navigation menu. Click to enter the Coverage Table workspace where you'll see the "Create Coverage Table" option to begin your comparison.

> **Info:** The Coverage Table feature is accessible from the main navigation menu in your Qumis dashboard.

![001 Pn](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/001.png)

## Step 1: Navigate to Coverage Table

From your Qumis dashboard, locate the **Coverage Table (BETA)** option in the left navigation menu. Click to enter the Coverage Table workspace where you'll see the "Create Coverage Table" option to begin your comparison.

## Step 2: Upload Your Policy Documents

Click **"Create Coverage Table"** to start. You'll be directed to the Policy Documents screen where you can:

- **Upload a single policy document** for initial analysis
- **Search and add documents from your Vault** using the search bar
- **Drag and drop files** directly into the upload area (supports PDF, Excel, Word, and image files including JPEG, PNG, TIFF)

![Policy Documents upload screen](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/002.png)

The Policy Documents screen allows you to upload or search for documents from your Vault

For this comparison, you'll want to upload at least two policy documents - typically the incumbent policy and a competing quote, or multiple quotes you're evaluating.

![Selected policy documents](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/003.png)

Your uploaded policy documents will appear with green checkmarks when successfully added

> **Tip:** You can add multiple policy documents at once. The system will automatically extract and compare relevant coverage information from each document.

## Step 3: Add Your Coverage Checklist Items

This is where the magic happens. The system will present you with two options:

1. **Copy and paste** coverage items from your existing proposal template or coverage checklist
2. **Select from our comprehensive checklist** of common insurance coverage elements

![Add Checklist Items screen](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/004.png)

Add coverage items by pasting from your template or selecting from the comprehensive checklist

The checklist includes essential items such as:

- Policy terms and carrier information
- Coverage limits and deductibles
- Liability coverages (General, Professional, Cyber, etc.)
- Exclusions and special provisions
- Endorsements and additional coverages

![Expanded coverage checklist](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/005.png)

The comprehensive checklist includes all standard coverage types and can be customized to your needs

> **Info:** Pro tip: You can customize this list to match your specific evaluation criteria or client requirements. The system remembers your preferences for future comparisons.

## Step 4: Generate Your Report

Once you've selected your coverage items and uploaded your documents, click **"Generate Coverage Table"**. The AI-powered analysis engine will:

- Extract key data points from each policy
- Cross-reference information across documents
- Compile strategic insights
- Validate accuracy using attorney-trained reasoning

![Report generation in progress](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/006.png)

The multi-agent system processes your documents in real-time, typically completing analysis in 5-10 minutes

This process typically takes 5-10 minutes, during which our multi-agent system performs real-time processing to ensure comprehensive analysis.

## Step 5: Review Your Coverage Comparison

Your completed Coverage Table provides a comprehensive side-by-side comparison showing:

- **Field-by-field coverage analysis** with clear status indicators
- **Match/Mismatch identification** highlighting differences between policies
- **Coverage gaps and advantages** clearly marked
- **Interactive review options** to dive deeper into specific coverage elements

![Completed Coverage Table report](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/007.png)

The final Coverage Table displays a detailed comparison with color-coded indicators for easy analysis

Use the filter options to focus on specific coverage types, view only differences, or export the comparison for client presentations.

> **Note:** The color-coded system makes it easy to identify:
>
> - **Green (Match)**: Coverage elements that align across policies
> - **Yellow (Partial)**: Areas with some differences that need review
> - **Red (Mismatch)**: Significant differences requiring attention
> - **N/A**: Coverage not found or not applicable

## Next Steps

With your Coverage Table complete, you can:

- **Share insights with clients** using professional, attorney-level analysis
- **Identify strategic leverage points** for negotiations
- **Document your recommendations** with clear, defensible reasoning
- **Save your analysis** to the Document Vault for future reference

Remember, the more you use Qumis, the more personalized and efficient your workflow becomes. Our AI learns from your usage patterns to deliver increasingly tailored insights.

- **Token Endpoint**: URL for exchanging authorization codes for tokens
- **JWKS URI**: JSON Web Key Set endpoint for validating tokens
- **Issuer**: The identifier of your OIDC provider

---

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Contact Qumis Customer Success

Reach out to your Qumis Customer Success Manager or email [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai) to initiate the SSO setup process. We'll schedule a brief kickoff call to review requirements and timeline.

### Step 2: Configure Qumis Application in Your IdP

Your IT team will need to add Qumis as an application in your identity provider. Qumis will provide you with:

- **Service Provider (SP) Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Qumis
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Where SAML assertions or OIDC tokens should be sent
- **Callback/Redirect URI**: For OIDC flows

*Follow your IdP's documentation to create a new SSO application with these values.*

### Step 3: Provide Configuration Details to Qumis

Once you've configured Qumis in your IdP, send the required information (listed in the "Information Required" section above) to your Qumis representative securely.

**For SAML:** You can provide either:

- IdP metadata XML file, OR
- Individual configuration values (Entity ID, SSO URL, Certificate)

**For OIDC:** Provide:

- Client ID and Client Secret
- Well-known configuration URL (if available), OR
- Individual endpoint URLs

### Step 4: Qumis Configuration

The Qumis team will configure the SSO connection on our platform using the information you provided. This typically takes 1-2 business days.

### Step 5: Testing

Once Qumis confirms the configuration is complete:

### Initial Test

A designated test user should attempt to log in to Qumis using SSO.

### Verify User Details

Confirm that user information (name, email) is populated correctly.

### Test Different Scenarios

- Existing user login
- Access to appropriate resources and permissions

### Step 6: Production Rollout

After successful testing:

### Enable SSO for Additional User Groups

Enable SSO for additional user groups as planned.

### Communicate the New Login Process

Communicate the new login process to your users.

### Update Internal Documentation

Update any internal documentation.

---

## User Login Experience

Once SSO is configured, your users will access Qumis as follows:

### Navigate to Qumis

Navigate to your organization's Qumis login page: `https://app.qumis.ai`

### Enter Email Address

Enter their company email address.

### Click Continue with SSO

Click "Continue with SSO".

### Redirect to Identity Provider

Users are redirected to your organization's identity provider.

### Authenticate and Access Qumis

After authenticating with your IdP, users are automatically signed into Qumis.

---

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

> **Info:**&#x20;
>
> - All SSO communications are encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols
> - Your IdP credentials are never stored by Qumis
> - Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified** with enterprise-grade security
> - Your organization's data remains private and is never used for AI training

### Authentication Flow

- SSO connections are scoped to your specific organization
- Each authentication request is validated against your IdP in real-time
- Session management follows security best practices with configurable timeout periods

---

## Multi-Organization Access (Advanced)

If your company has multiple Qumis organization instances (common with M\&A activity, international subsidiaries, or separate departments), you can configure External SSO Connections to allow users to authenticate across organizations with a single SSO setup.

Contact your Qumis Customer Success Manager if this applies to your use case.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Users receive "SSO Configuration Not Found" error

- Verify that the user's email domain matches the domain configured for SSO
- Confirm the SSO connection is active in Qumis
- Check that users are assigned to the Qumis application in your IdP

### SAML assertion errors

- Verify the X.509 certificate is current and hasn't expired
- Confirm the ACS URL is correctly configured in your IdP
- Check that attribute mappings match expected values

### OIDC authentication failures

- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Confirm redirect URI exactly matches the value in your IdP
- Check that required scopes (openid, email, profile) are granted

### Users created but missing information

- Review attribute/claim mappings in your IdP configuration
- Verify that user profiles in your IdP contain the required fields

### Support

> **Info:** For assistance with SSO configuration or troubleshooting, email [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai).
>
> When contacting support, please include:
>
> - Your organization name
> - Description of the issue
> - Screenshots of any error messages
> - Approximate time the issue occurred

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we enforce SSO as the only login method?

Yes. Once SSO is configured and tested, Qumis will automatically disable alternative authentication methods for your organization.

### What happens if our IdP experiences downtime?

Users will be unable to log in via SSO during IdP downtime. Contact Qumis support if you need temporary alternative access enabled.

### Can we configure multiple IdP connections?

Organizations typically use a single IdP connection. Contact your Customer Success Manager if you have a specific use case requiring multiple connections.

### How do we offboard users?

Remove user access in your IdP by unassigning them from the Qumis application. They will be unable to authenticate on their next login attempt.

### Does SSO support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Yes. MFA enforcement is managed through your identity provider. When MFA is required by your IdP, users will complete MFA as part of the SSO flow.

### Can we customize the login page?

Qumis provides a standard enterprise login experience. For custom branding requirements, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

# Security Best Practices

Source: guides/security-best-practices

## Overview

Security is fundamental to Qumis. This guide provides best practices to help you maintain the highest level of security when using our platform.

## Account Security

### Strong Password Requirements

Your Qumis password should meet these criteria:

At least 12 characters

Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Unique to your Qumis account

Changed every 90 days

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

> **Note:** We strongly recommend enabling MFA for all accounts to add an extra layer of security.

### Enable MFA

Go to Account Settings and enable Multi-Factor Authentication

### Choose Authentication Method

Select your preferred method: Authenticator app (recommended) or SMS

### Backup Codes

Save your backup codes in a secure location

### Test Your Setup

Log out and verify MFA is working correctly

## Data Protection

### Document Handling Best Practices

> **Tip:** Always verify document sensitivity levels before uploading to Qumis.

#### Before Uploading Documents

- **Review Content**: Check for sensitive information that should be redacted
- **Classify Data**: Understand your document's confidentiality level
- **Remove Metadata**: Clean documents of unnecessary metadata
- **Scan for Malware**: Ensure documents are virus-free

#### Document Storage

- **Organized Structure**: Use clear folder hierarchies and naming conventions
- **Access Controls**: Set appropriate permissions for shared documents
- **Regular Audits**: Review and remove outdated documents periodically
- **Version Control**: Maintain clear version history for important documents

### Data Privacy Measures

| Practice | Description | Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Access Review | Audit who has access to your documents | Monthly |
| Permission Updates | Remove access for users who no longer need it | As needed |
| Activity Monitoring | Review access logs and user activity | Weekly |
| Data Cleanup | Remove unnecessary or outdated documents | Quarterly |

## Network Security

### Secure Connection Practices

> **Warning:** Never access Qumis over unsecured public Wi-Fi without a VPN.

#### Recommended Network Security

1. **Use HTTPS Only**: Always verify the URL starts with `https://app.qumis.ai`
2. **VPN Usage**: Connect through a VPN when using public networks
3. **Network Monitoring**: Be aware of unusual network activity
4. **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure your firewall allows secure Qumis connections

### Browser Security

#### Essential Browser Settings

- **Enable automatic updates** to receive security patches
- **Block third-party cookies** for enhanced privacy
- **Use private/incognito mode** when accessing from shared computers
- **Clear cache regularly** to remove stored sensitive data

## User Access Management

Grant users only the minimum access required for their role

### Regular Access Reviews

Audit user permissions quarterly and adjust as needed

### Immediate Deprovisioning

Remove access immediately when employees leave or change roles

### Segregation of Duties

Separate critical functions among different users to prevent conflicts

### Session Management

Best practices for secure sessions:

- **Auto-Logout**: Enable automatic session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Single Session**: Avoid multiple concurrent sessions when possible
- **Logout Completely**: Always use the logout button instead of just closing the browser
- **Clear Session Data**: Clear cookies and cache after using shared computers

## Incident Response

# Quickstart

Source: quickstart

## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

### Clone your docs locally

During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.

### Start the preview server

1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

### Install our GitHub app

Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.

### Update your site name and colors

For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!

### Step 3: Go live

### Publish your docs

1. Commit and push your changes.
2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!

## Next steps

Now that you have your docs running, explore these key features:
