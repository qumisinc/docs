Source: get-started/foundations-for-success/implementing-ai

> **Info:** This guide provides a prescriptive, step-by-step roadmap for implementing **Qumis**, the attorney-trained Gen AI platform, within your insurance agency or brokerage. The strategy focuses on managing the major organizational shift by emphasizing **governance, role transformation, and sustained accuracy**.

---

The core principle is to treat Qumis as a **collaborative partner** and to **embed governance before scale**.

---

## Phase 1: Strategic Alignment & Governance (The Foundation)

This phase ensures all decisions are anchored to a clear business strategy and robust legal guardrails, utilizing **Qumis’s** core strengths: **Attorney-Trained AI** and **Enterprise Security**.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

Before engaging your team, you must internally confirm:

- **Project Mandate:** Senior leadership is committed to funding the project through the first year of metrics measurement.
- **Resource Allocation:** You have designated a **Qumis Governance Working Group (QGWG)** lead (likely the Project Manager) and secured a minimum of one part-time resource from **Compliance/Legal** to review policy in Step 1.4.

### Step 1: Craft the "Legal-Grade Speed" North Star and Core Value Statement

The goal is to define success and identify the key players who will drive the transformation.

| **1.1. Define the North Star**                        | **Facilitate a 1-hour "Vision Session"** with the **CEO**, Head of Sales/Production, and Head of Claims. Ask: "What major business metric are we trying to impact with attorney-trained **AI**?" Focus on measurable **outcomes**, not technology features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | *Deliverable:* Final **North Star Statement**. Example: "Achieve a 15% increase in premium growth and a 20% reduction in claims cycle time by embedding legal-grade analysis into every core workflow within 18 months." |
| **1.2. Identify High-Value Use Cases**                | **Conduct a 90-minute Brainstorming Session** with 3 top Brokers and 3 top Claims Professionals (Pros). Ask: "What are the 3 most complex documents or tasks where **legal-grade reasoning** would save you hours or secure a win?" and "Where does **manual analysis error** currently cost us the most time or money?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | *Deliverable:* Prioritized list of **3-5 Pilot Use Cases**. (e.g., Complex Directors and Officers (D\&O) Policy Comparison, Exclusions in a Catastrophic Claim).                                                          |
| **1.3. Conduct Stakeholder Mapping (Power/Interest)** | **Map all affected roles** on a 2x2 grid based on their *Power* (ability to approve/block) and *Interest* (how much their job changes). a. **High Power/High Interest:** *Manage Closely* (Executive Sponsor, **QGWG**). **Strategy:** Engage in weekly update meetings. b. **Low Power/High Interest:** *Keep Informed* (Account Managers, Claims **Pros**). **Strategy:** Engage in training and solicit feedback monthly. c. **High Power/Low Interest:** *Keep Satisfied* (Legal/Compliance). **Strategy:** Provide formal, quarterly security and governance reports. | *Deliverable:* **Power/Interest Grid** determining communication frequency and content for each group.                                                                                                                   |
| **1.4. Establish AI Governance Framework**            | The **QGWG** drafts the initial policy using **Qumis's** security guarantees as the foundation. a. **Mandate Private Document Vault:** Policy states all documents uploaded for analysis must use the **Qumis** Vault to ensure client data is protected. b. **Mandate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Policy defines clear **CHECKPOINTS** where a human review is required. *Example: Any output used for a final claim decision or policy coverage explanation to a client.*                                                                                                | *Deliverable:* **"Qumis Responsible Use Policy" (v1.0)**, formally approved by Legal/Compliance.                                                                                                                         |

## Phase 2: Implementation, Process Redesign, and Communication

This phase adapts your core business processes to leverage **Qumis's** capabilities, ensuring that every team member understands their new, elevated role.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

You must be able to:

- **Lead Change Impact Assessment (CIA) Workshops:** Understand the process of gathering the "As-Is" data through interviews and mapping to generate the "To-Be" vision.
- **Translate Features to Benefit:** Understand how **Qumis's** features (e.g., **Compare Documents**, **Claims Assessment**) directly address the bottlenecks in your four core workflows.

### Step 3: Redesign Core Workflows with Qumis

The goal is to eliminate manual document analysis and errors, shifting hours to client interaction and strategic judgment.

| Workflow         | "As-Is" Bottleneck/Error                                                                                                                                                    | Qumis Feature Integration ("To-Be" Process)                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Success Metric (Time/Quality)                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New Business** | Producer/Broker spends hours manually reviewing quotes and binders for non-obvious discrepancies before presenting to the client.                                           | **Broker/Producer** uploads competitive quotes to **Compare Documents**. **Qumis** instantly identifies true strategic leverage and non-standard exclusions. **Broker** uses this **Custom Report** to present authoritative advisory.        | **Time:** Reduction in **Quote-to-Bind Cycle Time**. **Quality:** 0 errors found in policy comparison audit.                                           |
| **Servicing**    | Account Manager (**AM**) searches for policy details across disparate systems to answer client coverage questions, often missing endorsements or amendments.                | **AM** uses **Chat with Documents** on the specific policy in the **Document Vault** to instantly verify coverage or find a specific exclusion clause. The **AM** can then use the **AI** to draft a compliant response.                      | **Time:** Reduction in **Average Handle Time (AHT)** for client coverage inquiries. **Quality:** Increase in **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**.   |
| **Claims**       | Claims **Pro** spends days manually interpreting complex policy language (especially Errors and Omissions (E\&O), **D\&O**) and writing the rationale for denial or approval. | Claims **Pro** uses **Claims Assessment** for legal-grade reasoning for coverage decisions. The pro utilizes the **Fill In Checklist (BETA)** to systematically verify all policy elements before generating a defensible **Custom Report**.  | **Time:** Reduction in **Claims Cycle Time** for complex cases. **Quality:** Reduction in claims file "Audit-Identified Policy Interpretation Errors." |
| **Renewal**      | Broker/**AM** misses cross-sell opportunities or fails to highlight new risks because they lack time for deep policy analysis.                                              | **AM** uses **Policy Analysis** to master the expiring policy’s key limits and exclusions in seconds, instantly identifying coverage gaps based on the client’s risk profile. **Broker** uses the insight to prepare a targeted upsell pitch. | **Business:** Increase in **Retention Rate** and **Cross-Sell/Upsell Conversion Rate**.                                                                |

### Step 4: Role-Specific Communication and Buy-In

Use a cascading communication plan, with managers delivering personalized messages to address specific fears and highlight professional growth.

| Role                     | Core Benefit from Qumis                                                  | Communication Strategy (Message to Deliver)                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Brokers**              | **Strategic Leverage** and **Faster Market Response**.                   | "Qumis makes you the **authoritative advisor** who moves faster than the competition. You get the **legal-grade insight** you need to **win more placements**."                                              |
| **Producers**            | **Faster Quote-to-Bind** cycle and **Policy Master** in seconds.         | "Your sales cycle shrinks. You can confidently discuss the complex coverage of a new placement and answer client questions instantly, increasing client trust."                                              |
| **Claims Professionals** | Accelerated, **Defensible Decisions**; **Elimination of Manual Errors**. | "Qumis acts like a **first-year associate, only faster and more accurate**, eliminating manual analysis errors and freeing you to focus on **judgment, negotiation, and client empathy**."                   |
| **Account Managers**     | **Time Recapture**; **Enhanced Customer Service**.                       | "Qumis is your new co-pilot for service. It frees up hours you spend digging for policy clauses, allowing you to handle more accounts and focus on **being the trusted advisor** and relationship builder."  |
| **Service Teams**        | **Expertise Democratization**; **Error Minimization**.                   | "You no longer need to wait for a senior underwriter to interpret complex language. Qumis gives you **attorney-level analysis** on demand, ensuring every client interaction is **accurate and compliant**." |

## Phase 3: Upskilling and Continuous Improvement (The Future State)

This phase locks in the cultural shift, emphasizing that **Qumis** is a learning partner that requires active engagement and iterative dialogue to deliver its best legal analysis.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

You must be able to:

- **Design Experiential Training:** Training must be hands-on, scenario-based, and focused on collaboration (**Iterative Dialogue**).
- **Sustain Momentum:** Implement an internal system to track best practices and continuously update the training materials.

### Step 5: Implement Attorney-Level Upskilling

The goal is to teach the team to treat the **AI** like a high-performing associate: clear instructions, critical review, and continuous discussion to refine the final work.

- **Adoption:** Track **Frequency of Use** (daily/weekly queries per user) and **Adoption Rate** (% of eligible staff using **Qumis** features in the new workflows).
- **Time/Efficiency:** Measure **AHT** for client servicing and **Time-to-Quote** for new business submissions.
- **Quality/Compliance:** Track the reduction in **Internal Audit Failures** related to policy or claim interpretation.

### Continuous Improvement Loop

- **Quarterly QGWG Review:** Review **KPIs** and team feedback. Identify the top 3 best-performing prompts/workflows and add them to the central **Prompt Library**.
- **Vendor Feedback:** Aggregate all reports of inaccurate/incomplete legal reasoning from the team and share with **Qumis** to leverage their **Bespoke** feature, where the "AI learns with use, becoming more personalized over time".

### Sustaining the Culture

Recognize and reward the **AI Accelerators** (your champions) who are successfully using the iterative dialogue to drive superior business results and mentor their peers.

# Identifying Use Cases

Source: get-started/foundations-for-success/identifying-use-cases

> **Info:** Adopting AI in insurance can feel overwhelming at first — especially if it's new to your team. This guide walks you through a **step-by-step process** for identifying where and how to embed Qumis into your daily workflows so you can get measurable results.

---

By the end of this article, you'll understand:

- How to map your team's workflows to Qumis features
- How to prioritize use cases that create fast, visible value
- How to define success metrics and track performance
- How to roll out AI responsibly across your organization

---

## Why It Matters

Teams that use Qumis successfully don't just "try AI" — they use it **intentionally**. They choose specific workflows, set clear expectations, and measure progress. This ensures the technology becomes an integral part of how they work rather than an experiment on the side.

The most successful users of Qumis include:

- **Producers and Brokers** who quickly understand what coverage their prospects have
- **Account Managers and Service Teams** who analyze and manage policy changes
- **Claims Professionals** who advocate for clients using clear, defensible policy interpretations

---

## Step-by-Step Framework for Identifying AI Use Cases

### Step 1: Map Your Workflow

Start by mapping out where your team spends most of its time. The goal is to find **document-heavy, repetitive tasks** that require judgment — the kind of work Qumis is built for.

**How to do it:**

### List your daily activities

For example, reviewing submissions, quoting, checking renewals, managing claims, or responding to client inquiries.

### Identify the document types

Note which documents you handle at each stage (quotes, policies, endorsements, contracts, COIs, complaints, etc.).

### Find pain points

Ask: "Where do we lose the most time or make the most errors?" Those are ideal starting points for AI.

Below is a guide showing how each workflow stage connects with a Qumis feature:

| Workflow Stage         | What It Means                                            | Qumis Feature                        | Value You'll See                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prospecting**        | Reviewing a prospect's current coverage                  | **Chat with Documents**              | Understand coverage faster and prepare smarter conversations with prospects          |
| **Quote Analysis**     | Comparing carrier quotes, binders, and submissions       | **Compare Documents**                | Identify key differences, exclusions, or advantages instantly                        |
| **Policy Checking**    | Reviewing policies for accuracy and completeness         | **Single Policy Analysis**           | Catch missing coverages and verify details before binding                            |
| **Account Management** | Managing ongoing client policies, endorsements, and COIs | **Contract Review & Coverage Table** | Ensure compliance, track requirements, and simplify renewals                         |
| **Claim Advocacy**     | Supporting clients through a claim                       | **Claims Analysis**                  | Analyze coverage for specific claim scenarios and provide defensible recommendations |

> **Tip:** Start with one stage (for example, prospecting or policy checking) and expand after your team gains confidence.

---

### Step 2: Prioritize by Impact and Effort

Once you've mapped your workflows, prioritize them using a simple two-by-two matrix:

|                 | **Easy to Implement**                                                               | **Harder to Implement**                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Impact** | Start here — these are your "quick wins" (e.g., quote comparisons, policy checking) | Plan next — large or complex processes (e.g., claim advocacy) |
| **Low Impact**  | Optional — automate only if time allows                                             | Avoid — minimal business benefit                              |

To evaluate impact, ask:

- Does this process happen frequently?
- Does it involve high-value clients or decisions?
- Would faster or more accurate results make a difference to customers or revenue?

---

### Step 3: Define What Success Looks Like

Before starting a pilot, choose **metrics** that help you measure improvement.

**How to set them:**

### Establish a baseline

Record how long a task takes now or how many documents are reviewed per week.

### Pick 2-3 key metrics

Such as:

- Time saved per document or per process
- Reduction in missed items or errors
- Faster turnaround on client deliverables
- Reduction in external legal or review costs

### Measure again after 30-45 days

You'll be able to see the real-world impact of Qumis.

**Example:**

> "Before Qumis, comparing three quotes took 3 hours. After introducing Qumis, it takes less than 30 minutes with improved accuracy."

---

### Step 4: Set Clear Roles and Governance

AI should enhance human expertise — not replace it.

**When rolling out Qumis:**

- **Producers and Brokers:** Use Qumis for initial document review and coverage insight before advising clients.
- **Account Managers and Service Teams:** Use Qumis to verify details, maintain consistency, and manage renewals.
- **Claims Professionals:** Use Qumis for coverage interpretation and defensible claim advocacy.

**To ensure long-term success:**

### Create review checkpoints

Have a team lead review outputs weekly during the first month.

### Use consistent prompts

Build a shared prompt library inside Qumis (e.g., "Summarize differences in property coverage between these quotes").

### Refine your approach

Use Qumis' *Custom Reports* and *Vault* features to document what works and share it across the team.

---

## Example Use Cases

| Role                    | Problem                                                          | How to Use Qumis                                                  | Metric for Success                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Producer**            | Hard to understand a new prospect's existing coverage            | Use *Chat with Documents* to review current policies instantly    | Reduce review time by 80%                |
| **Broker**              | Manual quote comparisons take hours                              | Use *Compare Documents* to highlight coverage differences         | Complete comparisons in under 30 minutes |
| **Account Manager**     | Policy changes and COIs are time-consuming to track              | Use *Contract Review* and *Coverage Table* to automate tracking   | 50% fewer manual compliance tasks        |
| **Claims Professional** | Difficult to identify applicable coverage language during claims | Use *Claims Analysis* for structured, defensible coverage reviews | Zero missed exclusions or provisions     |

---

# Change Management

Source: get-started/foundations-for-success/change-management

> **Info:** Implementing Qumis is not just about learning new technology — it's about transforming how your organization works.
>
> The insurance industry has a long history of established workflows and manual processes. Many professionals have developed expertise over decades, and they trust what's proven. However, the arrival of **Generative AI (GenAI)** is redefining what's possible. It can dramatically speed up policy analysis, improve accuracy, and reduce manual work — but only if your organization **manages the change thoughtfully**.
>
> This manual will teach you how to plan, guide, and sustain your Qumis implementation using the **ADKAR framework**, a proven model developed by Prosci to help people navigate change.

---

## What Is the ADKAR Framework?

**ADKAR** stands for:

1. **Awareness** – understanding why change is necessary
2. **Desire** – building motivation to support the change
3. **Knowledge** – learning how to make the change
4. **Ability** – putting new skills and behaviors into practice
5. **Reinforcement** – making the change stick

Each stage represents a milestone your people must achieve before the change can truly take hold. You can't skip steps; they build on one another.

---

## Step 1: Build Awareness

### What It Means

Awareness is helping your team understand **why** the organization is implementing Qumis and **what's at stake** if they don't adapt.

### Why It Matters

Insurance professionals are often cautious about new tools. Many have refined their workflows over decades and may feel that manual review or offshore outsourcing "works just fine." Without a clear "why," they'll see Qumis as extra work instead of an enabler.

### How to Build Awareness

### Craft a clear message from leadership

Communicate that Qumis isn't replacing expertise — it's **amplifying it**.

Example message:

> "We're implementing Qumis to reduce manual busywork so our teams can spend more time advising clients, not retyping policy details."

### Show the problem

Use data or examples:

- How much time is spent comparing policies manually?
- How often do errors occur due to manual entry or missed exclusions?

### Use relatable examples

Demonstrate real-life benefits:

- A broker who used Qumis to compare quotes in 10 minutes instead of 3 hours.
- A claims professional who used AI analysis to find coverage discrepancies others missed.

### Hold awareness sessions

- Host 30-minute "Why Qumis?" briefings for every department.
- Use visual demos showing before-and-after workflows.
- Encourage open discussion of fears or misconceptions.

> **Tip:** Awareness must come from leadership **and** direct managers. Employees trust messages most when they come from their immediate supervisors.

---

## Step 2: Create Desire

### What It Means

Desire is when people **want** to participate in and support the change.

### Why It Matters

People won't change their habits unless they see personal value. In insurance, that often means **saving time**, **reducing rework**, or **looking more professional** in front of clients.

### How to Build Desire

### Make it personal

Show how Qumis saves each role time and headaches.

Example: "You'll spend less time checking endorsements and more time winning renewals."

### Identify and engage champions

Find early adopters (e.g., a tech-savvy producer or service team member) who can model success. Let them share real examples of how Qumis made their job easier.

### Remove fears

Clarify that Qumis is **not** replacing jobs but improving quality and reducing burnout. Emphasize: "AI will handle the repetitive work; you'll handle the expert judgment."

### Incentivize adoption

Recognize or reward teams who complete their first successful Qumis workflow. Create friendly competitions (e.g., "Fastest Policy Checker of the Month").

---

## Step 3: Build Knowledge

### What It Means

Knowledge is giving your team the **skills and understanding** to use Qumis confidently.

### Why It Matters

Even motivated employees can get frustrated without clear, practical training — especially those who aren't used to AI tools or modern software platforms.

### How to Build Knowledge

### Create a structured training plan

Start with short sessions, not long lectures.

- **Session 1:** Logging in, uploading documents, and using Chat with Documents.
- **Session 2:** Comparing quotes and analyzing policies.
- **Session 3:** Using prompt libraries and custom reports.

### Use real examples

Train using your team's actual documents (quotes, policies, claims files). Familiar content helps learning stick.

### Record training sessions

So employees can rewatch when needed — ideal for those less confident with technology.

### Provide quick-reference guides

Offer one-page cheat sheets showing:

- How to upload and analyze a policy
- How to compare two documents
- How to use prompts effectively

### Encourage peer learning

- Pair less tech-savvy employees with "Qumis Champions."
- Create a Slack or Teams channel for Qumis questions and tips.

> **Tip:** Avoid information overload. People learn better through short, repeated exposure rather than one long session.

---

## Step 4: Develop Ability

### What It Means

Ability is when your team can **actually perform** the new behaviors — not just understand them.

### Why It Matters

Knowledge alone doesn't equal performance. You need to give people **practice, support, and feedback** until using Qumis becomes natural.

### How to Build Ability

### Start with low-risk tasks

Have teams analyze sample policies or claims before using Qumis on live client work.

### Set small goals

- Week 1: Upload and analyze one policy.
- Week 2: Compare two documents.
- Week 3: Use Qumis to generate one client-facing report.

### Provide on-the-job coaching

Managers or Qumis Champions should review outputs together. Discuss what went well and what can be improved.

### Encourage feedback

Ask users: "What confused you?" "What saved you the most time?" Capture feedback in a shared document or form.

### Celebrate early wins

Share stories where Qumis helped a client or saved hours of work. Public success stories build confidence across teams.

---

## Step 5: Reinforce the Change

### What It Means

Reinforcement ensures that using Qumis becomes a **habit**, not a one-time project.

### Why It Matters

Without reinforcement, old habits will return — especially in insurance, where "we've always done it this way" is a common refrain.

### How to Reinforce the Change

### Track usage and results

Use Qumis analytics (or internal tracking) to see how often features are used. Share metrics: "This month, Qumis saved our team 120 hours of manual work."

### Recognize consistent users

Highlight top adopters in company meetings or newsletters.

### Refresh training regularly

Offer quarterly "Qumis Refresher" sessions to introduce new features and address gaps.

### Document success stories

Turn real results into internal case studies (e.g., "How the Claims Team Reduced Review Time by 60%").

### Update procedures

Embed Qumis into standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklists. Example: "Step 2 – Upload policies into Qumis for automated review."

> **Tip:** Sustained reinforcement transforms AI from an "initiative" into part of your company culture.

## Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

| Challenge                                  | What's Happening                           | How to Address It                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **"We don't have time for this."**         | People are overloaded and fear extra work. | Start small — show how Qumis *saves* time on routine tasks.        |
| **"I don't trust AI."**                    | Fear of inaccuracy or job loss.            | Emphasize human oversight: AI supports expertise, not replaces it. |
| **"Our team's too set in our ways."**      | Long-standing habits are hard to break.    | Engage respected leaders early — their buy-in influences others.   |
| **"This isn't how we've always done it."** | Cultural resistance to innovation.         | Reinforce results — once people see value, attitudes shift.        |

---

## Step 0: Assess Readiness & Define Success

Before communicating the change, leadership must align on the goals and assess the organization's readiness. A clear starting point and destination are critical for success.

### Leadership Alignment Checklist

Use these questions to confirm strategic alignment before kickoff:

- Have we clearly identified the top 2-3 business problems Qumis will solve (e.g., proposal speed, error reduction, renewal efficiency)?
- Have we defined the 3-5 key metrics that will define a successful pilot?
- Is the executive sponsor prepared to dedicate at least 2 hours per month to champion this initiative?
- Have we used the **Value Tracker Pack** (see Step 4) to capture our *current* "before" metrics?

### The "Before" State Snapshot

Use the **Value Tracker Pack** to baseline your current metrics *before* the project begins. This transforms the tracker from a historical record into a proactive business case tool, clearly demonstrating ROI later.

---

## Step 1: Build Awareness

### Purpose

Help everyone understand **why** Qumis is being introduced and what challenges it solves.

### How to Build Awareness

### Deliver a leadership message

Link Qumis to real pain points with a clear message from leadership.

### Show before-and-after visuals

Demonstrate **Expert Review vs. Expert + Qumis Review** to illustrate the value.

### Address security questions head-on

Communicate that Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified** and that **client data is always private and never used for AI training**.

### Host 'Why Qumis?' sessions

Invite discussion and feedback to build understanding and buy-in.

### Communication Template

| Item               | Description              | Example                                                                                                          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**           | What to communicate      | "Qumis cuts manual policy reviews by 60%, freeing our best minds for client strategy."                           |
| **Audience**       | Who needs to hear it     | Producers, brokers, account managers, claims teams                                                               |
| **Messenger**      | Who delivers the message | Executive sponsor and direct managers                                                                            |
| **Key Objections** | Preemptive answers       | "Is our data safe? Yes. Qumis is SOC 2 certified, and client data is private and never used for model training." |
| **Method**         | Channels                 | Email, huddles, recorded demos                                                                                   |
| **Timing**         | When                     | Week 1 of rollout                                                                                                |
| **Follow-up**      | How to reinforce         | Share FAQs (including security details), collect feedback, show early wins.                                      |

> **Tip:** Use real customer or internal examples — people relate to stories, not statistics.

---

## Step 2: Create Desire

### Purpose

Turn understanding into **motivation**.

### How to Build Desire

### Show 'what's in it for me'

Demonstrate benefits for each role to build personal motivation.

### Identify and empower champions early

Find early adopters who can model success and influence others.

### Recognize early adopters

Reward visible progress to encourage continued adoption.

### Invite experts to co-author Gold Prompts

Build ownership and recognize domain knowledge by having experts contribute to the prompt library (see Step 5).

### The Competitive Edge

Motivation is driven by the desire to win and the fear of being left behind. Frame the conversation around the tangible business advantages Qumis provides.

**Use Testimonial Power:**

> **Note:** "As Connor Love, National Director of Growth at IMA, noted: 'I thought, "No way it catches everything." But after using it on layered programs and seeing it find discrepancies I missed, I was sold.' Qumis acts as a second set of expert eyes, ensuring nothing gets missed."

**Frame Competitive Scenarios:**

| Scenario Question                                                                                                                                                   | Implications                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "A competitor using Qumis can analyze and compare 5 quotes in the time it takes us to do one. What does that mean for our next big renewal?"                        | Speed to market, winning more placements.     |
| "We can now provide an 'attorney-level' rationale for every claims decision, creating a defensible audit trail. How does this strengthen our client relationships?" | Increased trust, accuracy, and defensibility. |

# Single Sign On

Source: get-started/setup-and-access/single-sign-on

> **Info:** This guide will help your IT team configure Single Sign-On (SSO) with Qumis. SSO allows your employees to access Qumis using your organization's existing identity provider credentials, streamlining access management and enhancing security.

---

Qumis supports both **SAML 2.0** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** protocols, making it compatible with all major enterprise identity providers including:

- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Okta
- Google Workspace
- OneLogin
- Auth0
- Ping Identity
- And other SAML 2.0 or OIDC-compliant providers

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the SSO setup process, ensure you have:

- **Administrative access** to your organization's identity provider (IdP)
- **Contact with your Qumis representative** to coordinate the setup
- **Organization details** ready (domain(s) to be used for SSO)
- **User provisioning plan** (which users or groups should have access to Qumis)

## Setup Timeline

Typical SSO implementation takes 1-3 business days, depending on your organization's internal processes and IdP configuration complexity.

---

## Information Required from Your Organization

Your Qumis Customer Success team will request the following information to configure SSO on our end:

### 1. Organization Details

- **Email Domain(s)**: Domain(s) that will be used for SSO authentication (e.g., yourcompany.com)
- **Primary Contact**: Name and email of the technical contact for SSO setup

### 2. Identity Provider Information

#### For SAML 2.0 Connections

- **IdP Entity ID / Issuer URL**: Unique identifier for your identity provider
- **SSO URL / Sign-On URL**: The endpoint where authentication requests will be sent
- **X.509 Certificate**: Public certificate from your IdP for validating SAML assertions
- **Attribute Mapping** (if different from defaults):
  - Email address attribute
  - First name attribute
  - Last name attribute

#### For OIDC Connections

- **Client ID**: OAuth client identifier from your IdP
- **Client Secret**: OAuth client secret (will be stored securely)
- **Authorization Endpoint**: URL for the OAuth authorization request
- **Token Endpoint**: URL for exchanging authorization codes for tokens
- **JWKS URI**: JSON Web Key Set endpoint for validating tokens
- **Issuer**: The identifier of your OIDC provider

---

## Configuration Steps

### Contact Qumis Customer Success

Reach out to your Qumis Customer Success Manager or email [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai) to initiate the SSO setup process. We'll schedule a brief kickoff call to review requirements and timeline.

### Configure Qumis Application in Your IdP

Your IT team will need to add Qumis as an application in your identity provider. Qumis will provide you with:

- **Service Provider (SP) Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Qumis
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Where SAML assertions or OIDC tokens should be sent
- **Callback/Redirect URI**: For OIDC flows

*Follow your IdP's documentation to create a new SSO application with these values.*

### Provide Configuration Details to Qumis

Once you've configured Qumis in your IdP, send the required information (listed in the "Information Required" section above) to your Qumis representative securely.

**For SAML:** You can provide either:

- IdP metadata XML file, OR
- Individual configuration values (Entity ID, SSO URL, Certificate)

**For OIDC:** Provide:

- Client ID and Client Secret
- Well-known configuration URL (if available), OR
- Individual endpoint URLs

### Qumis Configuration

The Qumis team will configure the SSO connection on our platform using the information you provided. This typically takes 1-2 business days.

### Testing

Once Qumis confirms the configuration is complete:

1. **Initial Test**: A designated test user should attempt to log in to Qumis using SSO
2. **Verify User Details**: Confirm that user information (name, email) is populated correctly
3. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - Existing user login
   - Access to appropriate resources and permissions

### Production Rollout

After successful testing:

1. Enable SSO for additional user groups as planned
2. Communicate the new login process to your users
3. Update any internal documentation

---

## User Login Experience

Once SSO is configured, your users will access Qumis as follows:

### Navigate to Qumis

Go to your organization's Qumis login page: `https://app.qumis.ai`

### Enter company email

Users enter their company email address.

### Click 'Continue with SSO'

Select the SSO option to proceed with authentication.

### Authenticate with your IdP

Users are redirected to your organization's identity provider to log in.

### Automatic sign-in

After authenticating with your IdP, users are automatically signed into Qumis.

---

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- All SSO communications are encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols
- Your IdP credentials are never stored by Qumis
- Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified** with enterprise-grade security
- Your organization's data remains private and is never used for AI training

### Authentication Flow

- SSO connections are scoped to your specific organization
- Each authentication request is validated against your IdP in real-time
- Session management follows security best practices with configurable timeout periods

---

## Multi-Organization Access (Advanced)

If your company has multiple Qumis organization instances (common with M\&A activity, international subsidiaries, or separate departments), you can configure External SSO Connections to allow users to authenticate across organizations with a single SSO setup.

Contact your Qumis Customer Success Manager if this applies to your use case.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Users receive 'SSO Configuration Not Found' error

- Verify that the user's email domain matches the domain configured for SSO
- Confirm the SSO connection is active in Qumis
- Check that users are assigned to the Qumis application in your IdP

### SAML assertion errors

- Verify the X.509 certificate is current and hasn't expired
- Confirm the ACS URL is correctly configured in your IdP
- Check that attribute mappings match expected values

### OIDC authentication failures

- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Confirm redirect URI exactly matches the value in your IdP
- Check that required scopes (openid, email, profile) are granted

### Users created but missing information

- Review attribute/claim mappings in your IdP configuration
- Verify that user profiles in your IdP contain the required fields

### Support

For assistance with SSO configuration or troubleshooting:

- **Email**: [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai)

When contacting support, please include:

- Your organization name
- Description of the issue
- Screenshots of any error messages
- Approximate time the issue occurred

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we enforce SSO as the only login method?

Yes. Once SSO is configured and tested, Qumis will automatically disable alternative authentication methods for your organization.

### What happens if our IdP experiences downtime?

Users will be unable to log in via SSO during IdP downtime. Contact Qumis support if you need temporary alternative access enabled.

### Can we configure multiple IdP connections?

Organizations typically use a single IdP connection. Contact your Customer Success Manager if you have a specific use case requiring multiple connections.

### How do we offboard users?

Remove user access in your IdP by unassigning them from the Qumis application. They will be unable to authenticate on their next login attempt.

### Does SSO support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Yes. MFA enforcement is managed through your identity provider. When MFA is required by your IdP, users will complete MFA as part of the SSO flow.

### Can we customize the login page?

Qumis provides a standard enterprise login experience. For custom branding requirements, please contact your Customer Success Manager.

# Chats

Source: features/chats

> **Info:** Use Qumis' **Chats** to ask natural-language questions about your insurance documents and get attorney-grade answers with citations. This guide walks you through the whole flow—from opening Chats to asking questions, saving work, and troubleshooting.

---

## What you can do with Chats (at a glance)

- Ask plain-English questions about policies, quotes, binders, applications, contracts, and claims docs.
- Get structured answers with legal-grade reasoning and references.
- Keep documents private; data in Qumis is **not used to train** the AI and is stored in a private encrypted vault.

---

## Before you start

- Have one or more documents ready (PDF, Word, Excel, images: JPG/PNG/TIFF).
- If your files are already in **Vault**, you can pull them directly into a chat later.

---

## 1) Open the Chats workspace

### Navigate to Chats

From the left sidebar, click **Chats**.

On **Home**, you'll also see other tools like *Chat with Documents*, *Compare Documents*, *Claims*, *Policy Analysis*, and *Contracts* (all accessible from the same sidebar later).

![Qumis Home screen showing navigation and feature cards](/images/screenshots/home-dashboard.png)

---

## 2) Start a new chat

### Create a new chat

In **Chats**, click **New Chat** at the top of the list.

### Choose how to add files

You'll see a welcome message and two ways to add files:

- **Search and Add Documents From Vault** (pull existing files), or
- **Drop files here** (drag & drop from your computer).

![New Chat empty view with upload options](/images/screenshots/chats-policy-analysis.png)

> **Tip:** You can add more than one file to the same chat to ask cross-document questions (e.g., compare a quote to a policy).

---

## 3) Add documents

### Option A — Upload from your computer

1. Drag a file into the **Drop files here** box, or click it to select a file.

### Option B — Pull from Vault

1. Click in the **Search and Add Documents From Vault** bar.
2. Search by file name and select the document(s) you want.

> **Note:** **Security note:** Documents live in your private, encrypted **Vault**; they remain protected and reusable across workflows.

---

## 4) Wait for automatic OCR & ingestion

- After you add files, Qumis runs OCR and parsing automatically.
- You'll see a **Processing OCR** progress window with a checkmark when each file finishes.

![Processing OCR window showing document extraction progress](/images/screenshots/chats-ocr-processing.png)

If you close the window accidentally, don't worry—processing continues in the background and you can start typing your question once the file shows as loaded.

---

## 5) Get oriented to the chat screen

Once at least one document is loaded, the chat view shows:

- **Documents** menu (top-right of the chat pane) with a badge count (e.g., “1”).
- **Hide Citations** toggle (top-right). Turn this off to **see** reference citations in responses.
- **Suggested actions** (buttons) to help you get started, such as:
  - *Analyze policy coverage*
  - *Identify key exclusions*
  - *Compare coverage to industry standards*
  - *Check for specific endorsements*

![Chats interface showing loaded document and suggested actions](/images/screenshots/chats-overview.png)

- **Chat list** (left sidebar) with your recent and older chats. Click any item to reopen it. You'll also see pagination at the bottom of the list.

### Submit and review the answer

Press **Ask ↵**.

Qumis reads the uploaded document(s) and replies with an answer. If citations are visible, click them to see the exact source passages extracted from your files.

> **Info:** **What kinds of analyses can I ask for?** Coverage checks, exclusions, policy requirements, legal compliance, claims assessments, and more.

---

## 7) Refine, dig deeper, and compare

- **Follow-ups:** Ask clarifying questions (“Show me where that exclusion is”) or ask Qumis to *quote the wording* that supports the answer.
- **Multiple docs:** Add additional files via the **Documents** menu and ask cross-document questions (e.g., *“Compare this quote to the binder and list material differences.”*).
- **Explain it simply:** Ask for plain-language summaries to share with clients or teammates.
- **Turn citations on:** If the **Hide Citations** toggle is on, click it to turn citations **off** (so references show).

---

## 8) Save and find your work later

- Every conversation is saved automatically in the **Chats** list on the left with a timestamp.
- Click any past chat to reopen it and continue where you left off.

---

## Best practices (for non-technical users)

- **Start broad, then narrow.** Begin with a big question (“Summarize key coverages and limits”), then follow with specifics (“List all sublimits and deductibles with page cites”).
- **Ask for the ‘why’.** If you’re unfamiliar with an answer, ask Qumis to *explain* it or *show the exact policy wording.*
- **Use Vault for organization.** Keep your latest policy, quote, binder, and endorsements in Vault so you can pull them into a chat quickly.
- **Respect privacy standards.** Qumis is SOC 2 Type I and does **not** train on your data. You can safely analyze client materials.

---

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my document after uploading

Wait for the **Processing OCR** window to finish. If it stalls, remove the file and re-add it. Check that the file type is supported (PDF, Word, Excel, JPG/PNG/TIFF).

### Responses don't show citations

Toggle **Hide Citations** off (top-right).

### My question seems too broad

Use a suggested action (buttons under the chat box) to guide the analysis, then ask follow-ups.

### I need to find an older conversation

Scroll the chat list on the left, or use pagination at the bottom to move between pages.

---

## Example prompts you can copy

```text Coverage Summary

```

```text Requirements Extraction
Extract all policy requirements and obligations I need to track.
```

```text Plain Language Explanation
Explain the deductible and sublimit structure like I'm new to insurance.
```

## Where Chats fits in the Qumis platform

Chats sits alongside **Compare Documents**, **Claims**, **Policy Analysis**, and **Contracts** to cover end-to-end insurance analysis. Many users start in Chats, then move to comparisons or report generation for client-facing deliverables.

# Document Vault

Source: features/document-vault

> **Info:** The **Vault** is your secure digital filing cabinet for all insurance-related documents. Upload PDFs, Word files, Excel sheets, or images and make them instantly accessible for Chats, Comparisons, Claims, and Custom Reports.

---

## What is the Vault?

- A centralized repository for all your uploaded files.
- Files stored here can be used across all Qumis tools — Chats, Comparisons, Claims, and Custom Reports.
- **My Vault** is private to you and only you can see your files.
- **Shared Vault** is visible to everyone in your company, allowing teams to collaborate on shared insurance policies and supporting documents.

---

## Before you start

> **Info:** **Prerequisites:**
>
> - Have documents ready to upload (PDF, Word, Excel, images: JPG/PNG/TIFF).
> - Know whether documents are for your personal use (My Vault) or team collaboration (Shared Vault).

---

## 1) Open the Vault

### Access the Vault

From the left sidebar, click **Vault**.

### Choose your vault type

You'll see two tabs:

- **My Vault** — your private document space.
- **Shared Vault** — shared company-wide document storage.

![Qumis Vault main interface showing My Vault and Shared Vault tabs](/images/screenshots/prompts-dashboard.png)

---

## 2) Upload a document

You have two ways to add documents to your Vault:

### Method 1 — Upload directly from your computer

#### Option A — Drag and drop

1. Simply drag your file(s) into the **Drop files here** box at the top of the Vault page.
2. Once the upload completes, a green confirmation will appear next to your file name.

#### Option B — Use the file picker

1. Click inside the **Drop files here** box.
2. This opens your computer's file browser (Finder or File Explorer).
3. Select one or more documents to upload, then click **Open**.

Supported file types: **PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, TIFF**.

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> You can upload multiple files at once.

![File picker dialog showing file selection for upload](/images/screenshots/vault-my-documents.png)

### Method 2 — Email documents directly to Qumis

You can send documents directly to your Vault without logging into Qumis by emailing them to [**clerk@qumis.ai**](mailto:clerk@qumis.ai).

### Attach documents to email

Attach one or more documents to an email (supported formats: PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, TIFF).

### Send to Qumis

Send the email to [**clerk@qumis.ai**](mailto:clerk@qumis.ai).

### Verify upload

Your documents will automatically appear in your **My Vault** within a few minutes.

This is a convenient way to capture quotes, binders, endorsements, and other documents as you receive them from underwriters, brokers, and other contacts—no need to remember to upload them later from storage.

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Use descriptive email subject lines to help organize your documents (e.g., "ABC Corp Quote Jan 2025"). The subject line will help you identify the document in your Vault.

---

## 3) Confirm successful upload

Once uploaded, your document appears in **My Vault** with a green highlight and checkmark. Each file shows:

- **Name** — file title (editable with the pencil icon).
- **Type** — document category such as *Reference* or *Attachment*.
- **Created At** — the upload date.
- **Actions** — options to delete or manage the file.

![Vault showing successfully uploaded file with green highlight and checkmark](/images/screenshots/vault-shared-documents.png)

### Set document type (optional but recommended)

After uploading, click the **Select Document Type** dropdown to categorize your file. This makes it easier to search and organize files later.

---

## 4) Manage and organize files

As your Vault grows, use these tools to stay organized:

- **Search bar** — find documents by name. Type a document name to locate it instantly.
- **Type filter** — filter by *Reference*, *Attachment*, or *All Types* to view specific categories.
- **Sorting** — click **Name** or **Created At** column headers to reorder your files.
- **Pagination** — navigate between pages of files using the arrows at the bottom if you have many documents.

![Vault view showing multiple documents with search, filters, and pagination controls](/images/screenshots/vault-shared-documents.png)

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Name files descriptively so they're easy to find later, e.g., "Acme Corp Property Policy 2025.pdf" instead of "policy.pdf".

---

## 5) Using Shared Vault for team collaboration

The **Shared Vault** lets your entire team work with the same documents.

- Documents in **Shared Vault** are visible to **everyone in your company** (but not outside your organization).
- Perfect for teams that collaborate on policy reviews, client files, binders, or endorsement documents.
- Everyone can access and analyze the same files in Chats, Comparisons, and other tools.

![Shared Vault tab showing shared company documents](/images/screenshots/prompts-dashboard.png)

### Best practices for Shared Vault

- **Upload finalized documents** — use Shared Vault for completed policies and shared resources, not drafts.
- **Keep current versions** — when a policy renews or changes, upload the new version so everyone has the latest information.
- **Use clear naming conventions** — help your team find files quickly with descriptive names like "ClientName\_Policy\_Year" so everyone knows what they're looking at.
- **Communicate changes** — if you update or replace a shared document, let your team know so they use the correct version.

---

## 6) Edit or delete files

### Rename a document

### Click the pencil icon

Click the **pencil icon** next to the file name in the **Name** column.

### Enter new name

Type a new name and confirm.

### Delete a document

### Click the trash icon

Click the **trash icon** in the **Actions** column.

### Confirm deletion

Confirm the deletion.

> **Note:**&#x20;
>
> If you delete from&#x20;
>
> **My Vault**
>
> , only you lose access. If you delete from&#x20;
>
> **Shared Vault**
>
> , everyone in your organization loses access to it—use caution when deleting shared documents. Consider messaging your team before removing shared files.

---

## 7) Use Vault files across Qumis tools

Once documents are in Vault, you can access them from anywhere in Qumis without re-uploading:

- **Chats** — Click "Search and Add Documents From Vault" to pull documents directly into your chat and ask questions about them.
- **Comparisons** — Compare multiple documents stored in Vault side-by-side.
- **Claims** — Evaluate coverages from stored claims documents.
- **Custom Reports** — Generate professional summaries from Vault documents.

This saves time and ensures every tool works with the same trusted document source.

---

## Example workflow

### Upload to My Vault

Upload a new client policy to **My Vault** with a descriptive name (e.g., "ABC Manufacturing General Liability 2025").

### Analyze in Chat

Create a new chat, search for the document in Vault, and pull it in.

### Ask questions

Ask questions about the policy to get analysis and insights.

### Share with your team

Upload the document to **Shared Vault** so colleagues can access and analyze it too.

### Reuse documents

Use the document in future chats, comparisons, and reports without re-uploading—just search for it in Vault.

---

## Best practices

- **Start with key documents** — upload your most-used policies, quotes, and templates so you can build your collection over time.
- **Use descriptive names** — future you and your teammates will appreciate clear file names.
- **Organize by client or type** — consider naming conventions that group related documents together logically.
- **Leverage Shared Vault for team efficiency** — if you work in a team, use Shared Vault for policies your whole team needs so nobody has to hunt for files.
- **Clean up old versions** — periodically review your vault and delete outdated documents to keep things tidy.
- **Upload once, use everywhere** — pull documents into Chats and other tools from Vault instead of re-uploading the same file multiple times.

---

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my file after uploading

Wait a few seconds for the upload to finish. Try refreshing the page. Confirm the file is in a supported format (PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, or TIFF).

### I uploaded to the wrong vault (My Vault vs. Shared Vault)

You can re-upload the document to the correct vault. Delete the original from the wrong location if needed.

### Can others outside my company see Shared Vault files?

No. Shared Vault is organization-only and visible only to people in your company.

### I want to delete a document but I'm not sure if anyone else is using it

If it's in Shared Vault, consider messaging your team before deleting to avoid disrupting their work. If it's in My Vault, only you have access, so you can delete freely.

### I accidentally deleted a file

Files are permanently deleted, but you can re-upload a copy if you have the original on your computer.

---

## Where Document Vault fits in the Qumis platform

Document Vault is the centralized hub for all your insurance documents. Use it alongside **Chats**, **Comparisons**, **Claims**, and **Custom Reports** to power your entire insurance analysis workflow. Keep your documents in Vault, then pull them into the tools you need for analysis, comparison, and reporting.

---

### Why use Document Vault?

Qumis Vault provides centralized document management integrated directly with Qumis AI workflows—enabling effortless collaboration, fast document retrieval, and consistent access to your key insurance files across the entire platform.

# Prompt Library

Source: features/prompt-library

> **Info:** The **Prompt Library** helps you create, save, and reuse structured AI instructions—called *prompts*—for faster and more consistent insurance document analysis. Whether you're drafting a detailed policy analysis or refining a question for Chat, the Prompt Library keeps your best prompts at your fingertips.

---

## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is a reusable instruction you give to Qumis AI. For example:

> **Note:** "Review this policy for exclusions related to subcontractor work and summarize findings for a contractor client."

Unlike general AI tools, Qumis is purpose-built for insurance professionals. The insurance expertise and reasoning are already built in—you don't need to tell Qumis to "think like an expert" or give it a persona. Simply focus on what you want analyzed and how you want the output formatted.

Prompts are great for:

- Standardizing analysis across your team.
- Quickly generating complex outputs (like coverage tables or policy comparisons).
- Saving your coverage checklists and frequently used review workflows.
- Reducing repetitive typing in Chats or Reports.

Once created, you can reuse a saved prompt anywhere in Qumis—in **Chats** or **Reports**—by clicking the book icon and selecting it.

---

## Before you start

- Have a sense of the types of questions or analyses you perform frequently.
- Know whether you want to create a prompt from scratch or refine an existing question using Qumis's prompt enhancement tool.

---

## 1) Access the Prompt Library

### Click Prompts from the left sidebar

Navigate to the **Prompts** section from the left sidebar.

### View the Prompt Library interface

You'll see a searchable list of saved prompts on the left and a detail view on the right.

### Search for prompts

Use the **Search prompts...** bar to quickly find prompts by name or keyword.

---

## 2) Browse existing prompts

The Prompt Library includes built-in and saved prompts. Each prompt shows:

- A descriptive title (e.g., "Workers Comp Review," "Cyber Coverage Analysis")
- A brief description of what the prompt does
- Associated documents or context

Click any prompt to view its full content and use it.

---

## 3) Create a new prompt

### Click + Create New button

Click the **+ Create New** button in the upper-right corner.

### Fill in the prompt form

A form appears with two fields:

- **Prompt Name** — give your prompt a clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Extract All Coverage Limits" or "Commercial General Liability Checklist")
- **Enter prompt content...** — type your instruction or question

### Write your prompt in plain English

Qumis will understand and execute it when used later. Focus on:

- What task you want Qumis to perform
- What information to extract or analyze
- How you want the output formatted
- Any specific focus areas

Since Qumis is built specifically for insurance professionals, the expertise is already built in—just describe what you need analyzed and how you want it presented.

```text Analysis Prompt
Review this policy for exclusions related to subcontractor work. Summarize findings in a client-friendly format highlighting risks.
```

```text Coverage Checklist Prompt
Using this Workers Compensation policy, verify coverage for the following: Employee classifications, state coverage, occupational disease coverage, employer's liability limits, and voluntary compensation. Flag any missing or inadequate coverages.
```

---

## 4) Refine your prompt with the magic wand

On the right side of the prompt editor, you'll see a **magic wand icon**. Clicking it activates Qumis's AI-powered refinement tool, which automatically improves your prompt for clarity, focus, and impact.

The magic wand works best when your initial idea is broad—let Qumis rewrite it into a professional-grade prompt by:

- Adding specific instructions
- Clarifying the desired output format
- Suggesting relevant data fields to extract
- Improving structure and specificity

You'll also find this magic wand in **Chats** and **Report creation** to polish ad-hoc questions into stronger prompts.

> **Tip:** The wand works best with broad starting questions. The more general your initial prompt, the more value the enhancement will add.

---

## 5) Save your prompt

### Click Save Prompt

Once you're happy with the text, click **Save Prompt** at the bottom right.

### Access your saved prompt

Your new prompt now appears in the left panel list and can be reused at any time.

### Use across modules

Your prompt is stored securely in your Qumis account and is accessible in other modules.

---

## 6) View and manage saved prompts

### Select a prompt from the list

Click the prompt name in the left list.

### View the prompt content

Its content appears in the editor pane on the right.

### Edit or delete the prompt

You can:

- Edit the name or text directly in the fields
- Click the **edit icon** (pencil) to modify the prompt
- Click the **delete icon** (trash) to remove it permanently

---

## 7) Example of a detailed prompt

Here's what a professional insurance prompt might look like:

**Example prompt content:**

> **Note:** "Analyze the provided Builders Risk insurance policy to assess its adequacy for a general contractor performing construction services in the Southeastern US. Include:
>
> - Named Insureds list
> - Coverage Territory with geographical focus
> - Coverage Limits per building and per job site for each coverage type
> - Additional Coverages available
> - Policy Requirements and Conditions
> - Key Exclusions and their impact on operations"

---

Edit the text directly or click the **magic wand icon** to refine it further.

### Save the changes

Click **Save Prompt** again to overwrite the old version.

> **Tip:** You can iterate on prompts over time, improving them based on results you get from using them.

---

## Best practices for creating prompts

- **Save your coverage checklists.** Convert the coverage verification checklists you use repeatedly into Prompt Library items. This ensures consistent coverage audits across your team and clients.
- **Document frequently asked questions.** Save common questions or analyses you perform (e.g., "Check for independent contractor coverage," "Summarize all exclusions").
- **Start broad, then refine.** Write your idea plainly, then use the magic wand to make it stronger.
- **Be descriptive with names.** Use clear, specific names like "WC Coverage Verification Checklist" or "Cyber Exclusions Audit" for easy searching.
- **Write detailed instructions.** The more specific your prompt, the better Qumis's analysis. Include context about what you're evaluating and why.
- **Specify output format.** Tell Qumis how you want results—table, list, narrative summary, checklist, etc.
- **Include focus areas.** Mention what's most important (e.g., "Flag gaps in contractor coverage" or "Highlight non-standard terms").
- **Group prompts by function.** Organize by use case: "Coverage Checklists," "Claims Analysis," "Quote Comparison," "Client Reports," etc.
- **Test before sharing.** Use a prompt on a sample document first to make sure it works as intended.
- **Reuse across tools.** A single prompt can power Chats, Reports, and document analyses.
- **Iterate over time.** Improve prompts based on results. Use the magic wand to refine prompts that aren't working as expected.

---

## Example prompts to get you started

### Coverage Checklists

```text WC Coverage Verification
Verify this Workers Comp policy includes employee classifications, state coverage, occupational disease coverage, employer's liability limits, and voluntary compensation. Flag any gaps.
```

```text General Liability Audit
Review this GL policy and confirm: named insureds match our records, coverage territory is correct, coverage limits are adequate for the business, and no unusual exclusions apply.
```

```text Cyber Policy Coverage Check
Confirm this cyber policy covers: first-party data breach response, third-party liability, regulatory fines, business interruption, and ransomware. Note any exclusions or sublimits.
```

### For Brokers

```text Quote Comparison
Compare this quote to the incumbent policy and identify 5 key differences that represent either better coverage or cost savings. Format for client presentation.
```

```text Premium Extraction
Extract all premium, taxes, and fees in a table format for proposal presentation. Include comparisons to current policy if available.
```

### For Claims Professionals

```text Coverage Determination
Analyze this claim scenario against the policy and determine if coverage applies. Cite specific policy language supporting your conclusion.
```

```text Exclusions Analysis
Identify all policy conditions, exclusions, and endorsements relevant to this type of claim. Flag any that may limit coverage.
```

### For Risk Professionals

```text Limits Summary
Summarize all coverage limits, sublimits, and deductibles by line of business in an easy-to-read table format.
```

```text Requirements Extraction
Extract all policy requirements and obligations the insured must follow to maintain coverage. Highlight those most critical for ongoing compliance.
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my saved prompt in Chats or Reports

Make sure it was saved successfully in the Prompts Library. Refresh the page and look for it under the book icon menu.

### The magic wand didn't change my prompt

Try giving it a broader or more general starting point for better results.

### I can't save a prompt

Check that both the name and text fields are filled in.

### I want to modify a prompt but don't want to lose the original

Create a new version with a slightly different name (e.g., "Extract Limits" vs. "Extract Limits - Client Facing"). Both versions will be available.

### My prompt returns different results on different policies

This is normal—Qumis adapts responses based on document content. Refine your prompt to be more specific if you need more consistent output. Use the magic wand to add structure and clarity.

---

## Where Prompt Library fits in the Qumis platform

The **Prompt Library** integrates with **Chats** and **Reports** to let you standardize your analysis workflows. Save time and improve consistency by reusing well-crafted prompts across your team's insurance analysis work.

# Claims Analysis

Source: reports/claims

> **Info:** The **Claim Analysis Report** helps brokers, account managers, and claims professionals understand whether an insured's policy (or multiple policies) may respond to a particular claim. By analyzing both the policy language and the claim's fact pattern, Qumis identifies key coverage triggers, exclusions, and conditions—and provides a clear opinion on how the policy applies.

---

## What this report does

When handling a claim, brokers and claims professionals often need to evaluate whether coverage applies and why. Qumis automates this analysis by:

- Reading and interpreting all relevant policy documents
- Reviewing the claim facts (e.g., FNOL, demand letter, lawsuit, or denial letter)
- Identifying relevant clauses, exclusions, and coverage triggers
- Explaining whether and why the claim should or shouldn't be covered
- Providing specific reasoning backed by policy language

You can also chat directly with the report to explore deeper coverage questions. Each chat is saved, and multiple threads can be maintained per report—making it especially valuable for complex claims and rebutting claim denials.

---

## Before you start

> **Note:** **Prerequisites:**
>
> - Have the insured's policy or policies ready.
> - Have claim documentation ready (FNOL, demand letter, lawsuit, ROR, claim denial letter, or other fact pattern).
> - Know the general nature of the claim you're analyzing.
> - Have 5-10 minutes to set up and generate the report.

---

## 1) Access the Claim Analysis tool

### Navigate to Claims

From the sidebar, click **Claims**. You'll see a list of your existing claim reports and the option to start a new one.

### Start a new report

Select **Generate Coverage Report** to begin.

Each completed analysis is saved and can be revisited at any time.

## 2) Enter the claim number

Start by giving your claim a reference number or name (e.g., "2025-004 Slip & Fall").

A five-step workflow guides you through the analysis:

- **Step 1: Claim Number**
- **Step 2: Policy Documents**
- **Step 3: Fact Patterns**
- **Step 4: Additional Information**
- **Step 5: Generate Report**

### Enter claim identifier

On **Step 1: Claim Number**, enter a claim number, file number, or any identifier you use to track this claim. This helps keep reports organized when managing multiple claims and will be used in your report title and saved analysis list.

### Proceed to next step

Click **Policy Documents** to proceed to Step 2.

---

## 3) Upload policy documents

On **Step 2: Policy Documents**, add the insured's insurance policy or policies:

### Add policy documents

You can add documents in two ways:

- Click **Search and Add Documents From Vault** to pull a previously uploaded policy from your Vault, or
- Drag and drop files into the **Drop files here** area, or click to select files from your computer.

### Verify document compatibility

Supported file types include PDF, Word, Excel, and image formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF). You can include up to 1000 pages total across all documents.

### Let Qumis process the documents

Qumis automatically reads and indexes each policy section—including coverage parts, endorsements, and definitions.

---

## 4) Upload the claim fact pattern

On **Step 3: Fact Patterns**, add documents describing the claim facts:

### Upload claim documentation

Add documents using the same methods as Step 2: search Vault or drag/drop from your computer.

Examples of documents to upload:

- First Notice of Loss (FNOL)
- Complaint or lawsuit
- Demand letter
- Reservation of Rights (ROR) letter
- Claim denial or response letter
- Medical records or incident reports
- Any other documentation describing the claim facts

### Provide comprehensive details

The more details you provide about the claim, the better Qumis can determine how specific policy provisions may apply or fail to apply.

---

## 5) Add additional context (optional)

On **Step 4: Additional Information**, you can provide optional context about the claim or coverage questions:

### Navigate to additional information

Click **Additional Information** on the left or click the **Additional Information** button to proceed to Step 4.

### Add coverage context

In the text box, you can add context such as:

- Specific coverage questions you want analyzed
- Focus areas (e.g., "Analyze whether this claim would trigger the Cyber coverage")
- Relevant policy provisions (e.g., "Focus on exclusions for professional services")
- Definitions to clarify (e.g., "Compare this fact pattern to the policy's wrongful act definition")
- Any coverage disputes or concerns

Providing context ensures the analysis targets your key concerns.

---

## 6) Generate your report

Once all required documents are uploaded and optional context is added:

### Initiate report generation

Click **Generate Coverage Report** at the bottom right. Qumis begins reading, correlating, and analyzing the policy language in light of the facts provided.

### Monitor progress

The process typically takes 5–10 minutes. You'll see a progress screen with status updates.

### Wait for completion

Qumis uses a multi-agent AI workflow to ensure reliability, context accuracy, and deep cross-referencing between policy and claim documents. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

---

## 7) Review your completed report

When the report is ready, Qumis provides a **Detailed Coverage Analysis** explaining:

**Detailed Coverage Analysis**

- Overview of the policy and the claim facts
- Summary of the parties involved
- Identification of relevant coverage provisions

**Coverage Determination Analysis**

- How the claim relates to the policy terms
- Which clauses or exclusions are relevant
- Whether coverage likely applies
- Key reasoning behind each determination
- Specific policy language supporting the analysis

Each section references specific policy provisions, helping you understand how coverage (or denial) was reached.

---

## 8) Chat with your report

Each claim report includes an interactive **Qumis Clerk** chat assistant that helps you explore coverage questions in more depth.

You can ask follow-up questions such as:

- "Does this claim trigger the policy's insuring agreement?"
- "Which exclusions apply here?"
- "Why did Qumis determine the claim is not covered?"
- "Show me where 'wrongful act' is defined in the policy."
- "What is the relevant exclusion and does it apply to these facts?"
- "Help me rebut the carrier's denial."

Chats are automatically saved, and you can maintain multiple chat threads per claim, allowing ongoing exploration and updates as the claim develops.

---

## 9) Use the report for coverage decisions and disputes

Once you have your Claim Analysis Report, use it strategically:

### For assessing complex claims

- Quickly understand which policy provisions apply to the claim facts
- Identify coverage triggers and any conditions the insured must meet
- Understand how specific policy language relates to the claim

### For rebutting claim denials

- Analyze the carrier's denial reasoning against the policy language
- Use the detailed analysis to support your Request for Reconsideration
- Cite specific policy provisions and coverage analysis in your rebuttal
- Provide the analysis to counsel if litigation is anticipated

### For supporting insureds

- Share the analysis to explain coverage (or lack of coverage) to the insured
- Use the report to educate the insured about relevant policy provisions
- Help the insured understand why coverage applies or doesn't apply

### For team and client communication

- Document your coverage reasoning and analysis
- Reference specific policy provisions in communications with carriers
- Provide professional, AI-backed coverage opinions to insureds and counsel

---

## 10) Access previous analyses

Your previously generated Claim Analysis Reports are saved and listed on the Claims dashboard.

### Navigate to Claims dashboard

Go to **Claims** in the left sidebar.

### View your reports

You'll see a table of all your analyses showing:

- NAME — Report name or claim identifier
- FILES — The policy and claim documents analyzed
- LAST MODIFIED — When the analysis was created or last accessed

### Open a saved analysis

Click any analysis to open it, review the coverage analysis, or add new chat questions.

---

## Best practices

- **Be thorough with claim facts.** Upload all relevant documentation (complaint, ROR, denial letter, medical records, etc.) so Qumis has complete context.
- **Include all relevant policies.** Upload all policies that might respond to the claim (primary, excess, umbrella, etc.).
- **Use the claim number consistently.** Use the same claim number each time you reference this claim for easy tracking and organization.
- **Add context about coverage questions.** If there's a specific coverage issue you want to focus on, mention it in Additional Information.
- **Review high-impact provisions first.** Focus on the most important coverage provisions that determine whether the claim should be covered.
- **Use chat for specific questions.** If coverage analysis is unclear, ask Qumis about specific policy language or how it applies to the facts.
- **Save important conversations.** Keep chat threads that explain your coverage reasoning for file documentation.
- **Document your analysis.** Use the report as documentation of your coverage analysis and reasoning.

---

## Time savings example

**Traditional claim analysis (typical):**

- Read and understand the policy: 30-60 minutes
- Review claim documentation and facts: 30-60 minutes
- Analyze policy provisions against claim facts: 1-2 hours
- Identify relevant exclusions and conditions: 30-60 minutes
- Form coverage opinion and document: 30-60 minutes
- **Total: 3-5 hours per claim analysis**

**With Qumis Claim Analysis Report:**

- Enter claim number: 1 minute
- Upload documents: 3 minutes
- Add context: 2 minutes
- Generate report: 5-10 minutes
- Review analysis and ask clarifying questions: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 16-26 minutes per claim analysis**

You can now complete multiple claim analyses in the time it would have taken to complete one manually.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My report didn't generate

Ensure you uploaded both policy and fact pattern documents. Both are required for analysis.

### My report is taking too long to generate

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or check that all documents uploaded successfully.

### I uploaded a claim but didn't get a coverage determination

Try providing more context under Additional Information—such as claim type, specific policy provisions to focus on, or coverage issues in dispute.

### The analysis doesn't address my coverage question

Use the chat feature to ask Qumis about specific coverage provisions or how they apply to your claim facts.

### Can I analyze multiple claims for the same policy?

Yes. Create separate reports for different claims using different claim numbers and different fact patterns.

### Can I export the analysis?

Yes. Use the Download button in the top-right corner of your completed report.

### Where are my past analyses?

All completed analyses appear on the **Claims dashboard**. Go to **Claims** in the left sidebar to access them.

---

## Where Claim Analysis Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Claim Analysis Report** is essential for claims professionals and coverage counsel. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc coverage questions, **Single Policy Analysis** for detailed individual policy review, and **Comparisons** for comparing multiple policies' responses to the same claim.

---

### Why use Claim Analysis Reports?

Claims analysis and coverage opinions require detailed policy review and fact analysis—critical work that is time-consuming and complex. With Qumis, analyzing coverage for a complex claim takes minutes, not hours. You can quickly understand how a policy responds to specific fact patterns, identify the reasoning behind potential coverage or exclusions, and support insureds or internal advocacy with AI-backed coverage opinions. The result is faster claim resolution, better-informed coverage decisions, and stronger support for claim denials or rebuttal of coverage disputes.

# Comparison Report

Source: reports/comparisons

> **Info:** The **Comparison Report** enables producers and brokers to compare multiple insurance policies, quotes, or binders side by side. Qumis reads and analyzes all uploaded documents, then generates a comprehensive coverage table—detailing key differences in coverages, exclusions, conditions, and policy language—all in minutes instead of days.

---

## What this report does

This tool is ideal when you need to compare:

- A quote vs. the incumbent's policy
- A renewal vs. alternative market quotes
- Multiple binders or applications
- Any other combination of documents where you want to identify meaningful differences

Qumis automatically:

- Compares and analyzes each document in detail
- Highlights coverage differences, exclusions, and conditions
- Evaluates policy language to explain implications for the insured
- Generates a Coverage Table showing side-by-side results, filterable by confidence and impact
- Lets you chat with the report for deeper insights into specific findings

---

## Before you start

> **Note:** **Prerequisites:**
>

6. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

### Review your comparison results

When complete, the **Comparison Dashboard** will display an interactive overview of your results with multiple tabs to explore:

- **Report** — Written analysis and findings
- **Visuals** — QumisScore benchmark and coverage alignment chart
- **Documents** — Source documents used for the analysis

### Understand the QumisScore

The **Visuals** tab includes the **QumisScore**—Qumis's AI-generated benchmark comparing how each policy performs across six key dimensions:

- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance** — How well the policy aligns with legal requirements
- **Exclusions and Endorsements** — Breadth and restrictiveness of exclusions versus added coverages
- **Policy Conditions and Definitions** — Clarity and favorability of terms and conditions
- **Claims Handling and Customer Service** — Carrier reputation and claim process quality
- **Cost and Insurer's Financial Stability** — Premium value and carrier financial strength
- **Coverage Alignment with Company Risks and Needs** — How well coverage matches business exposures

Each policy receives a QumisScore from 0-100 relative to the other documents you're comparing. This benchmarking shows which policy is stronger overall and on which specific dimensions, making it easy to illustrate the relative strengths and weaknesses of different options.

The **Coverage Alignment chart** visualizes these six dimensions as a spider/radar chart, giving you a quick visual comparison of how policies stack up against each other.

### Overview metrics

**Match Overview**

- Full Match — identical terms across documents
- Partial Match — similar but different terms
- No Match — terms present in one document but not the other

**Impact Analysis**

- Categorizes differences as Low, Medium, or High impact
- High-impact differences highlighted in red for urgent review

**Action Items**

- Tracks key areas that require your review or client discussion
- Medium impact items (orange) and high impact items (red)

These insights highlight where material differences exist and where coverage improvements could be negotiated.

### Explore the coverage comparison table

The **Coverage Table** displays each field and clause side by side—showing how each document treats the same concept.

Each row includes:

- Field Name (e.g., "General Aggregate Limit")
- The value or clause language from each document
- A status indicator (Match, Partial, or Mismatch)
- Warning icons highlighting significant differences

### Filters and search

The Coverage Table is fully interactive with multiple filtering options:

- **Status filter** — Show only Matches, Partials, or Mismatches
- **Impact filter** — Focus on Low, Medium, or High impact differences
- **Confidence filter** — Filter by Qumis's confidence level in each match
- **Search bar** — Search for specific fields or coverage types
- **Qumis Insights toggle** — Turn on natural-language explanations of key differences and their implications for the insured

### Download the comparison table

Click the **Download** button in the upper right to export your results to Excel.

This allows you to:

- Add your own notes and commentary
- Include the table in client-facing materials
- Highlight negotiation points for renewals or marketing
- Customize formatting for presentations

The downloaded file mirrors the on-screen table and is ideal for client presentations or renewal strategy decks.

### Chat with your comparison report

Like other Qumis reports, you can chat directly with your comparison to dive deeper into specific findings.

### Asking questions

You can ask questions such as:

- "Where does Policy B have narrower coverage than Policy A?"
- "Which exclusions differ significantly between these two documents?"
- "Explain the impact of the pollution exclusion in both policies."
- "What coverage improvements does the new quote provide?"

Qumis answers based on all documents in the comparison with specific citations.

### Saving chat conversations

- Chats are automatically saved within your report
- You can maintain multiple chat threads per comparison for different topics or scenarios
- Access your saved chat conversations by clicking the chat history
- Reference saved conversations later when refining your recommendations

### Use the QumisScore in your recommendations

The QumisScore is a powerful tool for illustrating policy value to your clients:

**For competitive positioning**

- Show clients which option scores highest overall and on which specific dimensions
- Explain why a higher-scoring policy might be worth the premium difference
- Highlight specific dimension scores where one policy significantly outperforms others

**For identifying improvement opportunities**

- Use dimension scores to identify which areas are weak across all options
- Recommend additional coverage or endorsements to address low-scoring dimensions
- Show where negotiation with carriers could strengthen the policy

**For client education**

- Use the spider chart visual to educate clients on what makes a policy strong
- Explain each of the six dimensions in plain language
- Help clients understand that the highest score doesn't necessarily mean the best fit—context matters

> **Note:** **Important context**
>
> - QumisScore benchmarks policies relative to each other, not against a global standard
> - A score of 81 doesn't mean "81% perfect"—it means this policy scores higher on these dimensions compared to the other documents in your comparison
> - Always combine QumisScore insights with your professional judgment about the client's specific needs

### Use the comparison for your pitch

Once you have your Comparison Report, use it strategically:

**For quote presentations**

- Show exactly how your quote differs from the incumbent policy
- Highlight areas where you provide better coverage
- Point out where you've negotiated better pricing or terms
- Demonstrate value through professional side-by-side analysis

**For renewal discussions**

- Compare renewal terms to market quotes obtained after going to market
- Show if renewal terms are competitive or if alternatives are available
- Identify what's changed from prior years
- Recommend best option based on coverage and pricing analysis

**For competitive analysis**

- Compare multiple competing quotes objectively
- Show pros and cons of each option
- Recommend the best fit for the prospect's specific needs

**Build credibility**

- The detailed analysis shows you've done thorough due diligence
- Side-by-side comparisons make complex information digestible
- Professional formatting enhances your advisory authority

### Access previous comparisons

Your previously generated Comparison Reports are saved and listed on the Comparisons dashboard.

1. Go to **Comparisons** in the left sidebar.

You can now compare multiple competitive options or conduct market analysis in a single afternoon instead of days.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My comparison is taking too long to generate

Average time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload the documents.

### I uploaded only one file

You must upload at least two documents to generate a comparison.

### I need to upload more than two documents

Qumis supports multiple document comparisons. Add as many documents as you need (up to 1000 pages total). The report will analyze all of them.

### The results seem incomplete

Try toggling filters or enabling Qumis Insights for more contextual explanations. Some fields may be specific to certain policy types and may not appear across all documents.

### Can I compare more than two documents?

Yes. You can upload multiple quotes or binders for multi-way comparisons.

### Where are my past comparisons?

All completed comparisons appear on the **Comparisons dashboard**. Go to **Comparisons** in the left sidebar to access them.

### Can I add or remove documents from an existing comparison?

Create a new comparison to include or exclude different documents. Each comparison is a fixed analysis of the documents included at generation time.

### I want to compare documents with my team

Download the comparison to Excel and share with team members. You can also use the Shared Vault to store documents so your team can access them for their own comparisons.

---

## Where Comparison Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Comparison Report** complements **Single Policy Analysis** for individual policy review and **Chats** for ad-hoc questions. Use it whenever you need to evaluate multiple documents against each other to make informed recommendations to prospects and clients.

---

### Why use Comparison Reports?

Policy comparisons are critical during renewal, prospecting, or marketing phases—but traditionally take hours or days to complete. With Qumis, you can compare hundreds of pages in minutes, quickly see where a quote differs from the incumbent, identify coverage gaps and opportunities, and produce professional client-ready materials in less time. By reading every clause and condition, Qumis reveals what's different, why it matters, and how it affects your insured—empowering brokers and producers to make faster, more informed recommendations. What once required extensive manual work now takes just minutes, helping you win renewals, identify upsell opportunities, and strengthen client trust.

# Contract Review

Source: reports/contract-review

> **Info:** The **Contract Review Report** helps account managers and service teams quickly determine whether an insured's policies, certificates, or quotes meet the insurance requirements outlined in a contract, lease, or agreement. Qumis automates the compliance review process—reading both documents, comparing requirements against coverages, and clearly identifying which requirements are compliant, non-compliant, or ambiguous—all in minutes instead of hours.

---

## What this report does

Qumis supports multiple types of contract analysis. Select the type that best matches your review scenario:

- **Contract Review** — General review of insurance requirements vs. policy documents.
- **Contract Compliance Review** — Detailed compliance validation of policy terms against requirements.
- **COI vs. Requirements** — Compare a Certificate of Insurance (COI) to contract requirements.
- **Lease & Agreement Analysis** — Analyze lease language for insurance compliance and liability clauses.
- **Construction Contracts** — Review construction agreements for indemnification and liability provisions.

The workflow is the same for all report types. Qumis automates compliance verification by reading both the contract and insurance materials, matching requirements clause by clause, and identifying coverage gaps.

---

## Before you start

> **Note:** **Prerequisites:**
>
> - Have the contract or agreement document ready (the document containing insurance requirements).
> - Have the client's insurance documentation ready (policy, COI, quote, or evidence of coverage).

## 6) Review your completed report

When complete, you'll see the **Compliance Comparison Report** with the following structure:

### Report tabs

- **Report** — The full compliance analysis (default view)
- **Documents** — The source contract and insurance documents used for the analysis

### Compliance Comparison Table

The report includes a structured table that summarizes:

**Contractual Requirement** — Extracted requirement from the contract (e.g., "General Liability: $1M per occurrence").

**Policy Details** — The corresponding coverage or limit found in the insurance documents.

**Compliance Level** — Status indicator showing:

- Compliant — Coverage meets or exceeds the requirement
- Non-Compliant — Coverage does not meet the requirement or is missing
- Ambiguous — Requirement or coverage is unclear and may need clarification
- Not Available — Information is not available to make a determination

**Notes** — Provides context, explanation, or verification details.

This view makes it easy to identify coverage gaps, confirm compliance, and prepare recommendations for your client.

## Best practices

- **Use the right report type.** Select the Contract Review type that best matches your situation for more targeted analysis.
- **Include all relevant documents.** Upload both the contract requirements and all insurance documentation so Qumis can make a complete assessment.
- **Add context about special situations.** If there are unique circumstances, explain them in Additional Information so Qumis can provide better analysis.
- **Review compliance items systematically.** Go through the report in order, starting with high-priority items like limits and additional insured requirements.
- **Use chat for clarification.** If a compliance determination is unclear, ask Qumis to explain the specific contract language or coverage provision.
- **Follow up on ambiguous items.** When a requirement is marked as ambiguous, use the Notes to understand what clarification is needed, then follow up with the carrier or client.
- **Save chat conversations.** Keep important Q\&A threads in the report as documentation of your compliance review.
- **Track changes over time.** When a client brings something into compliance, generate a new report to document the resolution.

---

## Time savings example

**Traditional compliance review (typical):**

- Read and understand contract requirements: 30-60 minutes
- Review insurance documents: 30-60 minutes

---

## Troubleshooting

### I only uploaded a contract, and the system won't generate a report.

You must upload at least one insurance-related document to perform a compliance review.

### My report is taking too long to generate.

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or check that all documents uploaded successfully.

### The report shows 'Ambiguous' results.

This indicates unclear or missing information. Use the chat feature to ask Qumis for clarification, or verify and upload an updated COI or policy version.

### Can I analyze multiple contracts at once?

Each report supports one contract set at a time for maximum accuracy. Create separate reports for different contracts.

### Where are my saved reports?

All generated reports appear on the **Contracts dashboard** under their respective category. Go to **Contracts** in the left sidebar to access them.

---

## Where Contract Review Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Contract Review Report** is essential for account management and client service teams. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc questions about specific requirements or coverage, and **Single Policy Analysis** for deeper analysis of specific policies when needed.

---

## Why use Contract Review Reports?

> **Info:** Insurance compliance verification is critical but time-consuming work. Qumis simplifies complex compliance reviews by analyzing both contracts and coverage evidence, summarizing requirements, identifying compliance status, and highlighting next steps. With Qumis, a task that once took hours now takes minutes—enabling your team to deliver faster, more accurate service and strengthen client trust while focusing on strategic advisory work instead of manual document review.

# Coverage Table

Source: reports/coverage-table

> **Info:** The **Coverage Table** feature helps brokers, account managers, and producers quickly create a side-by-side coverage summary for one or more insurance policies. Qumis reads your uploaded policy documents, extracts the relevant terms and conditions, and presents them in a structured, professional comparison table that's easy to share with clients.

---

## What this report does

The Coverage Table provides a clear, line-by-line view of coverage features across one or more policies. It's most helpful when preparing proposals, renewals, or side-by-side comparisons for clients.

With this report, you can:

- Extract coverage details, limits, and terms directly from uploaded policies or quotes.
- Compare key terms such as limits, retentions, and coverages across multiple documents.
- Identify where the language matches, differs, or requires review.
- Download the finished report for inclusion in client-facing materials.

It's best to create separate Coverage Table reports for each line of business (e.g., Cyber, General Liability, Property) using a relevant checklist.

---

## Before you start

- Have at least one policy document ready (quote, policy, binder, or application).
- If comparing multiple documents, have them all ready to upload (1-5 documents supported).
- Decide whether to use automatic extraction or a custom coverage checklist.
- If using a custom checklist, have your list of fields ready or saved in the Prompt Library.

---

### Access the Coverage Table tool

1. From the sidebar, click **Coverage Table (BETA)**.
2. You'll see a list of existing reports and the option to start a new one.
3. Click **Create Coverage Table** to begin.

Each generated table is saved automatically for future reference.

### Upload your policy documents

A three-step workflow guides you through creating your coverage table:

- **Step 1: Policy Documents**
- **Step 2: Add Checklist Items**
- **Step 3: Generate Report**

On **Step 1: Policy Documents**, add the documents you want to analyze:

1. You can add documents in two ways:
   - Click **Search and Add Documents From Vault** to pull previously uploaded documents from your Vault, or
   - Drag and drop files into the **Drop files here** area, or click to select files from your computer.
2. Supported file types include PDF, Word, Excel, and images (JPG, PNG, TIFF).
3. You can upload between 1 and 5 policy documents.
4. Qumis reads and parses the uploaded documents to extract key coverage items.

### Add checklist items

On **Step 2: Add Checklist Items**, choose how you want Qumis to build your coverage table.

You have two options:

### Option A — Auto-Generate Checklist (Recommended for beginners)

1. Toggle **Auto-Generate Checklist Items** **on** (enabled).
2. Qumis will automatically identify relevant fields and terms based on the uploaded documents.
3. This is the fastest way to create a table if you don't have a checklist defined.

### Option B — Use a Defined Checklist

1. Toggle **Auto-Generate Checklist Items** **off** (disabled).
2. You now have two ways to add your checklist:

**Method 1: Type or paste your checklist**

- Copy and paste the checklist items from your proposal template or coverage checklist.
- Enter the list of coverage items, limits, and/or terms you want to include in the coverage table.
- Example fields include:
  - Policy Term
  - Carrier
  - Intermediary
  - AM Best Rating
  - Coverage limits and deductibles
  - Specific coverage types relevant to the line of business

**Method 2: Use a saved checklist from Prompt Library**

- If you've saved your coverage checklists to the Prompt Library, click the **book icon**.
- Select the appropriate checklist from your saved prompts.
- The checklist fields will populate automatically.

### Best practices for checklist creation

### Create line-of-business-specific checklists

- Create separate Coverage Table reports for each line of business (e.g., General Liability, Commercial Property, Workers Compensation, Cyber).
- Use checklists that ask for information relevant to that specific line of business.
- Don't use your General Liability checklist on a Commercial Property policy—the fields won't match.

### Save frequently-used checklists

- Save your most-used coverage checklists to the Prompt Library for quick reuse.
- Name them clearly (e.g., "GL Coverage Checklist," "Commercial Property Limits and Deductibles").
- Update them as your proposals or client needs evolve.
- If you'd like your agency's standard checklists added to the Prompt Library for all users in your organization to access, contact your customer success manager.

### Include relevant fields

- Policy information (carrier, term, admitted status, ratings)
- Key limits and sublimits
- Deductibles and retentions
- Important coverage types and endorsements
- Territory and jurisdictional information

### Generate your coverage table

Once documents are uploaded and checklist items are defined:

1. Click **Generate Coverage Table** at the bottom right.
2. Qumis begins analyzing the uploaded documents, matching field values across policies, and identifying alignment or discrepancies.
3. Report generation typically takes 5–10 minutes as Qumis validates and extracts data using a multi-agent AI process.
4. You can leave the page and return later—the report will be ready when processing completes.

### Review your completed coverage table

When ready, the coverage table displays each policy side by side with fields such as:

- Writing Company
- AM Best Rating
- Effective Dates
- Limits and Retentions
- Coverage Inclusions and Exclusions

Each row indicates the status of that field:

- **Match** — Values are aligned across policies.
- **Partial** — Some differences exist.
- **Mismatch** — Policies differ on key details.

You can sort or filter by status, impact, or confidence level for quick review.

---

## 7) Chat with your coverage table

Each coverage table includes an interactive chat assistant powered by **Qumis Clerk**.

You can ask questions such as:

- "Which limits differ across these policies?"
- "What's the main difference between the two carriers?"
- "Show me where the Cyber Extortion coverage is located."
- "Explain the cyber coverage limits in each document."
- "What exclusions differ between these quotes?"

Chats are saved, and you can create multiple threads per table, making collaboration and deep dives effortless.

---

## 8) Download your coverage table

When satisfied, click **Download** to export the table for inclusion in client presentations or proposal documents.

The exported coverage table provides a professional summary of your analysis that can be shared with clients or underwriters. You can:

- Add the table to your client proposals
- Include it in renewal presentations
- Customize formatting for your brand
- Add your own notes and recommendations

---

## 9) Use the coverage table in client presentations

Once you have your Coverage Table, use it to:

**For quote presentations**

- Show clients side-by-side coverage comparisons of competing quotes
- Highlight where one option provides better coverage or value
- Demonstrate which insurer offers the best fit for their needs

**For renewal discussions**

- Compare renewal terms to expiring policy
- Show what's changing year-over-year
- Identify coverage improvements or areas of concern

**For marketing and proposals**

- Create professional coverage summaries for prospects
- Demonstrate thoroughness and expertise
- Provide clear documentation of coverage options

**Build credibility**

- Professional formatting shows attention to detail
- Clear comparisons make complex information accessible
- AI-backed extraction ensures accuracy

---

## 10) Access previous coverage tables

Your previously generated Coverage Tables are saved and listed on the Coverage Table dashboard.

1. Go to **Coverage Table** in the left sidebar.
2. You'll see a table of all your coverage tables showing:
   - NAME — Table name
   - FILES — The documents analyzed
   - LAST MODIFIED — When the table was created or last accessed
3. Click any table to open it, review the comparison, download it, or add new chat questions.

---

## Best practices

- **One line of business per table.** Create separate tables for GL, Property, Workers Comp, Cyber, etc., to ensure relevant fields are extracted.
- **Use saved checklists for consistency.** Save your frequently-used checklists to Prompt Library so you can reuse them across multiple clients.
- **Match checklist to documents.** Make sure your checklist asks for fields that actually exist in the documents you're analyzing.
- **Start with auto-generate.** If you're new to Coverage Tables or unsure what to extract, use auto-generate first to see what Qumis finds.
- **Review Partial and Mismatch rows closely.** These highlight coverage differences that are important to discuss with clients.
- **Refine over time.** After running a few tables, refine your checklists to focus on the fields most important to your clients.
- **Download for proposals.** Always download the table to include in professional client-facing materials.
- **Use chat for clarification.** If extracted information seems unclear, ask Qumis to explain specific fields or coverage provisions.
- **Combine multiple reports.** Create separate tables for each line of business and include them all in comprehensive proposals.

---

## Time savings example

**Traditional coverage table creation (typical):**

- Read through each policy document: 30-60 minutes
- Extract coverage limits and terms: 1-2 hours
- Create comparison table in Excel: 30-60 minutes
- Format for client presentation: 30-45 minutes
- **Total: 2.5-4.5 hours per coverage table**

**With Qumis Coverage Table Report:**

- Upload documents: 2 minutes
- Select or create checklist: 2-3 minutes
- Generate table: 5-10 minutes
- Review and download: 3-5 minutes
- **Total: 12-20 minutes per coverage table**

> **Tip:** You can now create multiple professional coverage tables in the time it would have taken to create one manually.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My table didn't extract the information I expected

Check that your checklist fields match what's actually in the documents. If you asked for "Cyber Limits" but uploaded a GL policy, Qumis won't find that information.

### Some fields show 'Not Available'

This means Qumis couldn't find that information in the document. The field may not exist in that policy, or it may be described differently.

### My coverage table is taking too long to generate

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload the documents.

### How do I create a checklist for a new line of business?

Look at a sample policy for that line and list all the key coverage items, limits, deductibles, and terms you want to track. Save it as a prompt for future use.

### Can I compare more than 5 documents?

No, Coverage Table supports 1-5 documents per table. If you need to compare more, create multiple tables.

### Where are my saved checklists?

Checklists saved to the Prompt Library can be accessed by clicking the book icon during checklist creation.

### Can I edit the table after it's generated?

You can download the table and edit it in Excel or your preferred tool. The table in Qumis is fixed once generated.

---

## Where Coverage Table fits in the Qumis platform

The **Coverage Table** complements **Comparisons** for policy-level differences and **Single Policy Analysis** for detailed individual policy review. Use Coverage Tables when you need clean, client-ready summaries of coverage information to include in proposals and presentations.

---

### Why use Coverage Table?

The Coverage Table simplifies what used to be a manual, time-intensive process of reviewing and comparing multiple policies. With Qumis, you can generate consistent, professional coverage summaries in minutes, identify coverage gaps or differences instantly, and provide clear, visual insights to clients and producers. Transform your policy comparison workflow—from manual spreadsheets to AI-powered precision.

### Example: Writing an effective prompt

Here's an example of how a detailed, context-rich prompt might look:

*"You will be provided with 1 document: General liability insurance policy for a construction company operating in the Southeastern United States.*

*Task: Analyze the provided general liability insurance policy for a construction company offering general construction, design/build, construction management, and upfit/renovation services in the Southeastern United States. The analysis should be comprehensive and objective, identifying potential biases or limitations in the policy's coverage. The report should be suitable for a construction company executive seeking to understand the policy's strengths and weaknesses. The analysis should focus on the following aspects:*

- *Named Insureds: List all named insureds and verify their accuracy.*
- *Coverage Territory: Clearly define the geographical coverage of the policy.*
- *Class Codes and Exposures: Create a table listing all class codes, their corresponding exposure bases, and the locations they apply to.*
- *Policy Form: Determine if the policy is occurrence-based, claims-made, or claims-made and reported. Justify your conclusion.*
- *Limits, Deductibles, and Retentions: List all policy limits, deductibles, and retentions, clarifying their application..."*

> **Tip:** The more specific your prompt, the more precise and useful your report will be.

## Best practices

- **Be specific in your prompts.** The more detailed your instructions, the better Qumis can tailor the output to your needs.
- **Define your audience.** Specify whether the report is for executives, underwriters, clients, or internal use—this affects tone and detail level.
- **Keep prompts focused on a single objective** (e.g., exclusions analysis, policy comparison) for clearer results.
- **Request specific formats.** If you want tables, bullet points, or particular section structures, state this clearly in your prompt.
- **Upload relevant, complete documents** for more accurate results.
- **Save successful prompts.** When you create a prompt that works well, save it to the Prompt Library for future use.
- **Iterate and refine.** If the first report isn't quite right, use the chat feature to refine the analysis, then update your prompt for next time.
- **Use for unique situations.** Custom Reports excel when standard report types don't quite fit your needs.
- **Leverage the magic wand.** Use the magic wand icon to refine your prompt if you're unsure how to structure it.
- **Test with different formats.** Experiment with different prompt structures to find what works best for your use cases.

---

## Example prompts for different use cases

**For executive coverage summary:** *"Analyze this commercial property policy and create an executive summary suitable for a C-suite audience. Focus on: total limits and deductibles, major coverage grants, critical exclusions that create risk, and 3-5 key recommendations for coverage improvements. Use clear, non-technical language."*

**For regulatory compliance review:** *"Review this workers compensation policy for compliance with \[State] requirements. Create a checklist showing: required coverages (met/not met), statutory limits, mandatory endorsements, and any deficiencies that need immediate attention."*

**For prospect analysis:** *"Compare this prospect's current general liability policy to industry best practices for \[Industry]. Identify: coverage gaps, inadequate limits, missing endorsements, and 5 specific improvements we could provide. Format as a competitive analysis suitable for a sales presentation."*

**For coverage adequacy assessment:** *"Assess whether this cyber insurance policy adequately protects a \[Company Type] with \[Annual Revenue] in revenue. Evaluate: first-party vs third-party coverage balance, limits relative to company size, critical exclusions for this industry, and specific coverage enhancements needed."*

**For exclusions analysis:** *"Analyze the attached General Liability policy and identify all exclusions related to subcontractors. Summarize each exclusion in plain language and note whether the policy provides any exceptions or carve-backs. Present findings in bullet points."*

---

## Troubleshooting

### My report didn't produce the output I expected

- Review your prompt for clarity. Did you specify exactly what you wanted and how you wanted it formatted?
- Use the chat feature to ask Qumis to reformat or refocus specific sections.

### The report is too general or not detailed enough

- Your prompt may need more specificity. Add detailed instructions about what to analyze and how deep to go.
- Specify that you want "detailed" or "comprehensive" analysis with examples.

### My custom report is taking too long to generate

- Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. Very complex prompts may take longer.
- If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or simplify your prompt.

### I want to reuse a successful prompt

Save effective prompts to the Prompt Library so you can select them from the dropdown for future reports.

### Where are my past custom reports?

All completed reports appear on the **Custom Report dashboard**. Go to **Custom Report** in the left sidebar to access them.

### Can I update a report after it's generated?

The report itself is fixed, but you can use the chat feature to get additional analysis or clarifications, which are saved with the report.

---

## Where Custom Report fits in the Qumis platform

The **Custom Report** is the most flexible tool in Qumis, filling the gaps when specialized analysis is needed beyond the standard report types. Use it alongside **Single Policy Analysis** for general policy reviews, **Comparisons** for side-by-side analysis, **Contract Reviews** for compliance checks, and **Claims Analysis** for coverage opinions—but turn to Custom Reports when you need something uniquely tailored to your situation.

---

### Why use Custom Reports?

The Custom Report is Qumis's most flexible report type — giving you full control over the scope, tone, and depth of the analysis powered by Qumis's deep reasoning and contextual understanding of insurance policies.

Use it when you need:

- A **tailored deep-dive** into one or more policies
- To **automate repetitive reporting** tasks
- Or to create **client-ready deliverables** using Qumis's deep policy understanding

Custom Reports give you the power to create exactly the analysis you need, formatted precisely for your audience. Whether you're preparing executive summaries, conducting specialized industry analysis, or creating unique client deliverables, Custom Reports let you leverage Qumis's deep analytical capabilities while maintaining complete control over the output. The result is professional, tailored insurance analysis that would take hours to produce manually, delivered in minutes and ready for your specific use case.

> **Tip:** The Custom Report unlocks the full analytical power of Qumis — driven entirely by your expertise and creativity.

## 7) Use the report for your pitch

Once you have your Single Policy Analysis Report, use it to:

- Reference specific weaknesses and gaps to show where current coverage is inadequate
- Recommend coverage improvements based on Qumis's analysis
- Highlight where you can negotiate better terms

* Use specific policy sections and exclusions cited in the report
* Show you've done your homework by referencing details from their existing policy
* Demonstrate value by explaining what's missing or could be improved

- The detailed analysis gives you credibility and expertise
- Speak authoritatively about their coverage without lengthy manual review
- Use the chat feature to answer follow-up questions before your pitch

## 8) Download or share

### Export as PDF

Click **Download** in the top right of the completed report to export it as a professional PDF.

### Share with stakeholders

Share insights with your team or clients for quick follow-up and discussion.

Downloaded reports include your company name and Qumis analysis notes—ideal for client presentations.

---

## 9) Access previous reports

Your previously generated Single Policy Analysis Reports are saved and listed on the Single Policy Analysis dashboard.

### Navigate to Single Policy

Go to **Single Policy** in the left sidebar.

### Review your reports table

You'll see a table of all your reports showing:

- **NAME** — Report name
- **FILES** — The policy file analyzed
- **LAST MODIFIED** — When the report was created or last accessed

### Open a saved report

Click any report to open it, review the analysis, or add new chat questions.

---

## Best practices

### Add context for better analysis

The more detail you provide in "Additional Information," the more targeted Qumis's analysis will be. Include industry specifics, operational details, and focus areas.

### Review before pitching

Always review the full report before meeting with the prospect so you understand the nuances of their coverage and can speak confidently.

### Use chat to prepare

Ask Qumis clarifying questions about exclusions, limits, and terms before your pitch so you're fully prepared for client questions.

### Highlight the wins

Focus your pitch on opportunities where your firm can provide better coverage, more favorable terms, or cost savings. Use specific examples from the report.

### Save your conversations

Keep your chat threads with the report—they become part of your analysis file and help with consistency across multiple client touchpoints.

### One policy per report

Create separate analyses for each policy so reports stay organized and focused. For side-by-side comparisons, use the Comparisons feature.

---

## Time savings example

**5-9 hours per policy**

- Initial policy review: 1-2 hours
- Detailed coverage analysis: 2-3 hours
- Identifying gaps and opportunities: 1-2 hours
- Preparing pitch materials: 1-2 hours

**15-25 minutes per policy**

- Upload policy: 2 minutes
- Add context: 2 minutes
- Generate report: 5-10 minutes
- Review and ask clarifying questions: 5-10 minutes

> **Tip:** **Dramatic efficiency gains:** You can now analyze multiple prospect policies in a single afternoon instead of days—giving you more time to focus on building relationships and winning accounts.

---

## Troubleshooting

### My report is taking too long to generate

Average generation time is 5–10 minutes. If it exceeds 15 minutes, refresh the page or re-upload your document. Complex or lengthy policies may take slightly longer.

### I don't see my uploaded document

Ensure you've added it in the "Policy Documents" section (Step 1) before clicking "Generate Report." Check that the file shows a green checkmark and document name after upload.

### Can I analyze more than one policy at once?

The Single Policy tool is designed for one document at a time to ensure accuracy and focus. For side-by-side comparisons, use the **Comparisons** feature instead.

### Where are my past analyses?

All completed reports appear on the **Single Policy Analysis dashboard**. Go to **Single Policy** in the left sidebar to access them. Reports show name, associated files, and last modified date.

### Can I edit the report after it's generated?

The report itself is generated by Qumis and cannot be directly edited, but you can add notes and chat questions. Use the chat feature to clarify specific points or ask for deeper analysis on any section.

### I want to compare two policies

Create separate Single Policy Analysis reports for each policy, then use the **Comparisons** tool to review them side-by-side with detailed variance analysis.

---

## Where Single Policy Analysis fits in the Qumis platform

Single Policy Analysis is purpose-built for the broker/producer workflow of evaluating prospects' existing policies. Use it alongside **Chats** for ad-hoc questions, **Comparisons** for side-by-side policy reviews, and **Custom Reports** for tailored client deliverables.

---

### Why use Single Policy Analysis?

Traditional policy analysis can take hours or days—reading, annotating, comparing, and summarizing dense legal documents. With Qumis, you can analyze a full policy in minutes, identify coverage gaps and negotiation opportunities instantly, and position your firm as a trusted advisor to win new business faster. What once took days now takes minutes, letting you focus on relationships, not paperwork.

**When to use:**

- Policy numbers, dates, names
- Single amounts (premium, deductible)
- Yes/No or single-choice fields

**Example format:**

```json
{"field_key": "value"}
```

**Examples:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Policy Number | `{"policy_number": "POL-2024-001"}` |
| Effective Date | `{"effective_date": "2024-01-15"}` |

| Named Insureds with Role | `[{"name": "ABC Corp", "role": "Primary"}, {"name": "XYZ Inc", "role": "Additional"}]` |

---

## Writing Good Instructions

The **instructions** field tells the AI how to find and extract the value. Good instructions lead to accurate extractions.

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Describe exactly what to look for
2. **List alternative names** - Include different terms that might be used
3. **Specify format** - Tell the AI how to format the output
4. **Provide context** - Explain where to look in the document

### Instruction Template

> **Note:** Extract \[what to find]. \[Where to look]. \[Format instructions]. \[Alternative terms].

### Examples

| Field | Good Instruction |
|-------|------------------|
| **Policy Number** | "Extract the unique policy identifier. Look in the declarations page header or policy information section. This may be labeled as 'Policy Number', 'Policy No.', 'Certificate Number', or 'Policy ID'." |
| **Effective Date** | "Extract the policy start date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). Look for 'Effective Date', 'Policy Period From', 'Inception Date', or 'Coverage Begins'. If only month/year is shown, use the 1st of the month." |
| **Deductible** | "Extract the per-occurrence deductible amount as a number without currency symbols. Look in the deductible schedule or declarations. May be labeled as 'Deductible', 'Retention', or 'Self-Insured Retention (SIR)'." |
| **Covered Perils** | "Extract all perils explicitly covered by the policy as an array. Look in the 'Covered Causes of Loss' or 'Insured Perils' section. Include both named perils and any 'all-risk' designation." |

---

# Development

Source: development

> **Info:** **Prerequisites**:
>
> - Node.js version 19 or higher
> - A docs repository with a `docs.json` file

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system.

### Install the Mintlify CLI

```bash
npm i -g mint
```

### Preview locally

Navigate to your docs directory where your `docs.json` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Custom ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview does not align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```bash
npm mint update
```

## Validating links

The CLI can assist with validating links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

## Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

## Code formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime

This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

1. Remove the currently-installed version of the CLI: `npm remove -g mint`
2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm i -g mint`

### Issue: Encountering an unknown error

Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Then run `mint dev` again.

Curious about what changed in the latest CLI version? Check out the [CLI changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify?activeTab=versions).

# Creating Custom Templates

Source: guides/creating-custom-templates

# Creating Custom Templates

Custom templates in Qumis help you standardize document creation and streamline workflows for your organization. This guide will walk you through creating, managing, and using custom templates.

## Understanding Templates

Templates in Qumis are pre-formatted documents that serve as starting points for common insurance documents such as:

- Policy documents
- Claims forms
- Risk assessment reports
- Compliance checklists
- Client correspondence

## Creating Your First Template

### Access Template Builder

Navigate to **Tools** → **Template Builder** from the main dashboard.

### Choose Template Type

Select the type of template you want to create:

- Document Template
- Email Template
- Report Template
- Form Template

### Design Your Template

Use the visual editor to:

- Add text fields and placeholders
- Insert dynamic variables (e.g., `{{client_name}}`, `{{policy_number}}`)
- Format sections with headers and styles
- Add conditional logic for dynamic content

### Save and Test

- Name your template descriptively
- Add tags for easy discovery
- Test with sample data to ensure proper formatting

## Template Variables

Templates support dynamic variables that automatically populate with relevant data:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|

# Policy Comparison Guide

Source: guides/policy-comparison

## Getting Started with Qumis Coverage Table

**Welcome to the Qumis Coverage Table feature!** - your powerful tool for comparing insurance policies with attorney-level precision. This guide will walk you through creating your first coverage comparison table, helping you unlock strategic insights that go beyond basic policy differences.

## Overview: What is the Coverage Table?

The Coverage Table is an AI-powered comparison tool that allows you to analyze multiple insurance policies side-by-side. Whether you're evaluating quotes, comparing renewal options, or assessing coverage gaps, this feature transforms complex policy analysis into clear, actionable insights.

### Navigate to Coverage Table

From your Qumis dashboard, locate the **Coverage Table (BETA)** option in the left navigation menu. Click to enter the Coverage Table workspace where you'll see the "Create Coverage Table" option to begin your comparison.

> **Info:** The Coverage Table feature is accessible from the main navigation menu in your Qumis dashboard.

![001 Pn](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/001.png)

## Step 1: Navigate to Coverage Table

From your Qumis dashboard, locate the **Coverage Table (BETA)** option in the left navigation menu. Click to enter the Coverage Table workspace where you'll see the "Create Coverage Table" option to begin your comparison.

## Step 2: Upload Your Policy Documents

Click **"Create Coverage Table"** to start. You'll be directed to the Policy Documents screen where you can:

- **Upload a single policy document** for initial analysis
- **Search and add documents from your Vault** using the search bar
- **Drag and drop files** directly into the upload area (supports PDF, Excel, Word, and image files including JPEG, PNG, TIFF)

![Policy Documents upload screen](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/002.png)

The Policy Documents screen allows you to upload or search for documents from your Vault

For this comparison, you'll want to upload at least two policy documents - typically the incumbent policy and a competing quote, or multiple quotes you're evaluating.

![Selected policy documents](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/003.png)

Your uploaded policy documents will appear with green checkmarks when successfully added

> **Tip:** You can add multiple policy documents at once. The system will automatically extract and compare relevant coverage information from each document.

## Step 3: Add Your Coverage Checklist Items

This is where the magic happens. The system will present you with two options:

1. **Copy and paste** coverage items from your existing proposal template or coverage checklist
2. **Select from our comprehensive checklist** of common insurance coverage elements

![Add Checklist Items screen](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/004.png)

Add coverage items by pasting from your template or selecting from the comprehensive checklist

The checklist includes essential items such as:

- Policy terms and carrier information
- Coverage limits and deductibles
- Liability coverages (General, Professional, Cyber, etc.)
- Exclusions and special provisions
- Endorsements and additional coverages

![Expanded coverage checklist](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/005.png)

The comprehensive checklist includes all standard coverage types and can be customized to your needs

> **Info:** Pro tip: You can customize this list to match your specific evaluation criteria or client requirements. The system remembers your preferences for future comparisons.

## Step 4: Generate Your Report

Once you've selected your coverage items and uploaded your documents, click **"Generate Coverage Table"**. The AI-powered analysis engine will:

- Extract key data points from each policy
- Cross-reference information across documents
- Compile strategic insights
- Validate accuracy using attorney-trained reasoning

![Report generation in progress](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/006.png)

The multi-agent system processes your documents in real-time, typically completing analysis in 5-10 minutes

This process typically takes 5-10 minutes, during which our multi-agent system performs real-time processing to ensure comprehensive analysis.

## Step 5: Review Your Coverage Comparison

Your completed Coverage Table provides a comprehensive side-by-side comparison showing:

- **Field-by-field coverage analysis** with clear status indicators
- **Match/Mismatch identification** highlighting differences between policies
- **Coverage gaps and advantages** clearly marked
- **Interactive review options** to dive deeper into specific coverage elements

![Completed Coverage Table report](/images/screenshots/policy-comparison-report-steps/007.png)

The final Coverage Table displays a detailed comparison with color-coded indicators for easy analysis

Use the filter options to focus on specific coverage types, view only differences, or export the comparison for client presentations.

> **Note:** The color-coded system makes it easy to identify:
>
> - **Green (Match)**: Coverage elements that align across policies
> - **Yellow (Partial)**: Areas with some differences that need review
> - **Red (Mismatch)**: Significant differences requiring attention
> - **N/A**: Coverage not found or not applicable

## Next Steps

With your Coverage Table complete, you can:

- **Share insights with clients** using professional, attorney-level analysis
- **Identify strategic leverage points** for negotiations
- **Document your recommendations** with clear, defensible reasoning
- **Save your analysis** to the Document Vault for future reference

Remember, the more you use Qumis, the more personalized and efficient your workflow becomes. Our AI learns from your usage patterns to deliver increasingly tailored insights.

Ready to transform how you compare policies? Start creating your first Coverage Table today and experience the clarity, speed, and precision that sets Qumis apart.

# Qumis Single Sign-On (SSO) Setup Manual

Source: guides/qumis-sso

## Overview

This guide will help your IT team configure Single Sign-On (SSO) with Qumis. SSO allows your employees to access Qumis using your organization's existing identity provider credentials, streamlining access management and enhancing security.

Qumis supports both **SAML 2.0** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** protocols, making it compatible with all major enterprise identity providers including:

- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Okta
- Google Workspace
- OneLogin
- Auth0
- Ping Identity
- And other SAML 2.0 or OIDC-compliant providers

## Prerequisites

> **Info:** Before beginning the SSO setup process, ensure you have:
>
> - **Administrative access** to your organization's identity provider (IdP)
> - **Contact with your Qumis representative** to coordinate the setup
> - **Organization details** ready (domain(s) to be used for SSO)
> - **User provisioning plan** (which users or groups should have access to Qumis)

## Setup Timeline

Typical SSO implementation takes 1-3 business days, depending on your organization's internal processes and IdP configuration complexity.

---

## Information Required from Your Organization

Your Qumis Customer Success team will request the following information to configure SSO on our end:

### 1. Organization Details

- **Email Domain(s)**: Domain(s) that will be used for SSO authentication (e.g., [yourcompany.com](http://yourcompany.com))
- **Primary Contact**: Name and email of the technical contact for SSO setup

### 2. Identity Provider Information

#### For SAML 2.0 Connections

- **IdP Entity ID / Issuer URL**: Unique identifier for your identity provider
- **SSO URL / Sign-On URL**: The endpoint where authentication requests will be sent
- **X.509 Certificate**: Public certificate from your IdP for validating SAML assertions
- **Attribute Mapping** (if different from defaults):
  - Email address attribute
  - First name attribute
  - Last name attribute

#### For OIDC Connections

- **Client ID**: OAuth client identifier from your IdP
- **Client Secret**: OAuth client secret (will be stored securely)
- **Authorization Endpoint**: URL for the OAuth authorization request
- **Token Endpoint**: URL for exchanging authorization codes for tokens
- **JWKS URI**: JSON Web Key Set endpoint for validating tokens
- **Issuer**: The identifier of your OIDC provider

---

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Contact Qumis Customer Success

Reach out to your Qumis Customer Success Manager or email [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai) to initiate the SSO setup process. We'll schedule a brief kickoff call to review requirements and timeline.

### Step 2: Configure Qumis Application in Your IdP

Your IT team will need to add Qumis as an application in your identity provider. Qumis will provide you with:

- **Service Provider (SP) Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Qumis
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Where SAML assertions or OIDC tokens should be sent
- **Callback/Redirect URI**: For OIDC flows

*Follow your IdP's documentation to create a new SSO application with these values.*

### Step 3: Provide Configuration Details to Qumis

Once you've configured Qumis in your IdP, send the required information (listed in the "Information Required" section above) to your Qumis representative securely.

**For SAML:** You can provide either:

- IdP metadata XML file, OR
- Individual configuration values (Entity ID, SSO URL, Certificate)

**For OIDC:** Provide:

- Client ID and Client Secret
- Well-known configuration URL (if available), OR
- Individual endpoint URLs

### Step 4: Qumis Configuration

The Qumis team will configure the SSO connection on our platform using the information you provided. This typically takes 1-2 business days.

### Step 5: Testing

Once Qumis confirms the configuration is complete:

### Initial Test

A designated test user should attempt to log in to Qumis using SSO.

### Verify User Details

Confirm that user information (name, email) is populated correctly.

### Test Different Scenarios

- Existing user login
- Access to appropriate resources and permissions

### Step 6: Production Rollout

After successful testing:

---

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

> **Info:**&#x20;
>
> - All SSO communications are encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can we enforce SSO as the only login method?

Yes. Once SSO is configured and tested, Qumis will automatically disable alternative authentication methods for your organization.

# Quickstart

Source: quickstart

## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

### Clone your docs locally

During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.

### Start the preview server

1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

### Install our GitHub app

Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.

### Update your site name and colors

For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Tip:**&#x20;
>
> Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!

### Step 3: Go live

### Publish your docs

1. Commit and push your changes.
2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
