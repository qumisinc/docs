title: "Change Management"
---
> Implementing Qumis is not just about learning new technology — it’s about transforming how your organization works.
>
> The insurance industry has a long history of established workflows and manual processes. Many professionals have developed expertise over decades, and they trust what’s proven. However, the arrival of **Generative AI (GenAI)** is redefining what’s possible. It can dramatically speed up policy analysis, improve accuracy, and reduce manual work — but only if your organization **manages the change thoughtfully**.
>
> This manual will teach you how to plan, guide, and sustain your Qumis implementation using the **ADKAR framework**, a proven model developed by Prosci to help people navigate change.

## What Is the ADKAR Framework?

**ADKAR** stands for:

1. **Awareness** – understanding why change is necessary
2. **Desire** – building motivation to support the change
3. **Knowledge** – learning how to make the change
4. **Ability** – putting new skills and behaviors into practice
5. **Reinforcement** – making the change stick

Each stage represents a milestone your people must achieve before the change can truly take hold. You can’t skip steps; they build on one another.

## Step 1: Build Awareness

### What It Means

Awareness is helping your team understand **why** the organization is implementing Qumis and **what’s at stake** if they don’t adapt.

### Why It Matters

Insurance professionals are often cautious about new tools. Many have refined their workflows over decades and may feel that manual review or offshore outsourcing “works just fine.” Without a clear “why,” they’ll see Qumis as extra work instead of an enabler.

### How to Build Awareness

1. **Craft a clear message from leadership.**\
   Communicate that Qumis isn’t replacing expertise — it’s **amplifying it**.\
   Example message:

   > “We’re implementing Qumis to reduce manual busywork so our teams can spend more time advising clients, not retyping policy details.”
2. **Show the problem.**\
   Use data or examples:
   - How much time is spent comparing policies manually?
   - How often do errors occur due to manual entry or missed exclusions?
3. **Use relatable examples.**\
   Demonstrate real-life benefits:
   - A broker who used Qumis to compare quotes in 10 minutes instead of 3 hours.
   - A claims professional who used AI analysis to find coverage discrepancies others missed.
4. **Hold awareness sessions.**
   - Host 30-minute “Why Qumis?” briefings for every department.
   - Use visual demos showing before-and-after workflows.
   - Encourage open discussion of fears or misconceptions.

> 💡 **Tip:** Awareness must come from leadership **and** direct managers. Employees trust messages most when they come from their immediate supervisors.

## Step 2: Create Desire

### What It Means

Desire is when people **want** to participate in and support the change.

### Why It Matters

People won’t change their habits unless they see personal value. In insurance, that often means **saving time**, **reducing rework**, or **looking more professional** in front of clients.

### How to Build Desire

1. **Make it personal.**
   - Show how Qumis saves each role time and headaches.
   - Example: “You’ll spend less time checking endorsements and more time winning renewals.”
2. **Identify and engage champions.**
   - Find early adopters (e.g., a tech-savvy producer or service team member) who can model success.
   - Let them share real examples of how Qumis made their job easier.
3. **Remove fears.**
   - Clarify that Qumis is **not** replacing jobs but improving quality and reducing burnout.
   - Emphasize: “AI will handle the repetitive work; you’ll handle the expert judgment.”
4. **Incentivize adoption.**
   - Recognize or reward teams who complete their first successful Qumis workflow.
   - Create friendly competitions (e.g., “Fastest Policy Checker of the Month”).

## Step 3: Build Knowledge

### What It Means

Knowledge is giving your team the **skills and understanding** to use Qumis confidently.

### Why It Matters

Even motivated employees can get frustrated without clear, practical training — especially those who aren’t used to AI tools or modern software platforms.

### How to Build Knowledge

1. **Create a structured training plan.**\
   Start with short sessions, not long lectures.
   - **Session 1:** Logging in, uploading documents, and using Chat with Documents.
   - **Session 2:** Comparing quotes and analyzing policies.
   - **Session 3:** Using prompt libraries and custom reports.
2. **Use real examples.**\
   Train using your team’s actual documents (quotes, policies, claims files). Familiar content helps learning stick.
3. **Record training sessions.**\
   So employees can rewatch when needed — ideal for those less confident with technology.
4. **Provide quick-reference guides.**\
   Offer one-page cheat sheets showing:
   - How to upload and analyze a policy
   - How to compare two documents
   - How to use prompts effectively
5. **Encourage peer learning.**
   - Pair less tech-savvy employees with “Qumis Champions.”
   - Create a Slack or Teams channel for Qumis questions and tips.

> 💡 **Tip:** Avoid information overload. People learn better through short, repeated exposure rather than one long session.

## Step 4: Develop Ability

### What It Means

Ability is when your team can **actually perform** the new behaviors — not just understand them.

### Why It Matters

Knowledge alone doesn’t equal performance. You need to give people **practice, support, and feedback** until using Qumis becomes natural.

### How to Build Ability

1. **Start with low-risk tasks.**
   - Have teams analyze sample policies or claims before using Qumis on live client work.
2. **Set small goals.**
   - Week 1: Upload and analyze one policy.
   - Week 2: Compare two documents.
   - Week 3: Use Qumis to generate one client-facing report.
3. **Provide on-the-job coaching.**
   - Managers or Qumis Champions should review outputs together.
   - Discuss what went well and what can be improved.
4. **Encourage feedback.**
   - Ask users: “What confused you?” “What saved you the most time?”
   - Capture feedback in a shared document or form.
5. **Celebrate early wins.**
   - Share stories where Qumis helped a client or saved hours of work.
   - Public success stories build confidence across teams.

## Step 5: Reinforce the Change

### What It Means

Reinforcement ensures that using Qumis becomes a **habit**, not a one-time project.

### Why It Matters

Without reinforcement, old habits will return — especially in insurance, where “we’ve always done it this way” is a common refrain.

### How to Reinforce the Change

1. **Track usage and results.**
   - Use Qumis analytics (or internal tracking) to see how often features are used.
   - Share metrics: “This month, Qumis saved our team 120 hours of manual work.”
2. **Recognize consistent users.**
   - Highlight top adopters in company meetings or newsletters.
3. **Refresh training regularly.**
   - Offer quarterly “Qumis Refresher” sessions to introduce new features and address gaps.
4. **Document success stories.**
   - Turn real results into internal case studies (e.g., “How the Claims Team Reduced Review Time by 60%”).
5. **Update procedures.**
   - Embed Qumis into standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklists.
   - Example: “Step 2 – Upload policies into Qumis for automated review.”

> 💡 **Tip:** Sustained reinforcement transforms AI from an “initiative” into part of your company culture.

## Common Challenges and How to Overcome Them

| Challenge                                  | What’s Happening                           | How to Address It                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **“We don’t have time for this.”**         | People are overloaded and fear extra work. | Start small — show how Qumis _saves_ time on routine tasks.        |
| **“I don’t trust AI.”**                    | Fear of inaccuracy or job loss.            | Emphasize human oversight: AI supports expertise, not replaces it. |
| **“Our team’s too set in our ways.”**      | Long-standing habits are hard to break.    | Engage respected leaders early — their buy-in influences others.   |
| **“This isn’t how we’ve always done it.”** | Cultural resistance to innovation.         | Reinforce results — once people see value, attitudes shift.        |
