# Implementing AI

>This guide provides a prescriptive, step-by-step roadmap for implementing **Qumis**, the attorney-trained Gen AI platform, within your insurance agency or brokerage. The strategy focuses on managing the major organizational shift by emphasizing **governance, role transformation, and sustained accuracy**.

---

The core principle is to treat Qumis as a **collaborative partner** and to **embed governance before scale**.

---
## Phase 1: Strategic Alignment & Governance (The Foundation)

This phase ensures all decisions are anchored to a clear business strategy and robust legal guardrails, utilizing **Qumis’s** core strengths: **Attorney-Trained AI** and **Enterprise Security**.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

Before engaging your team, you must internally confirm:

- **Project Mandate:** Senior leadership is committed to funding the project through the first year of metrics measurement.
    
- **Resource Allocation:** You have designated a **Qumis Governance Working Group (QGWG)** lead (likely the Project Manager) and secured a minimum of one part-time resource from **Compliance/Legal** to review policy in Step 1.4.

### Step 1: Craft the "Legal-Grade Speed" North Star and Core Value Statement

The goal is to define success and identify the key players who will drive the transformation.

|Action|How to Execute (Step-by-Step)|Deliverable/Rationale|
|---|---|---|
|**1.1. Define the North Star**|**Facilitate a 1-hour "Vision Session"** with the **CEO**, Head of Sales/Production, and Head of Claims. Ask: "What major business metric are we trying to impact with attorney-trained **AI**?" Focus on measurable **outcomes**, not technology features.|_Deliverable:_ Final **North Star Statement**. Example: "Achieve a 15% increase in premium growth and a 20% reduction in claims cycle time by embedding legal-grade analysis into every core workflow within 18 months."|
|**1.2. Identify High-Value Use Cases**|**Conduct a 90-minute Brainstorming Session** with 3 top Brokers and 3 top Claims Professionals (Pros). Ask: "What are the 3 most complex documents or tasks where **legal-grade reasoning** would save you hours or secure a win?" and "Where does **manual analysis error** currently cost us the most time or money?"|_Deliverable:_ Prioritized list of **3-5 Pilot Use Cases**. (e.g., Complex Directors and Officers (D&O) Policy Comparison, Exclusions in a Catastrophic Claim).|
|**1.3. Conduct Stakeholder Mapping (Power/Interest)**|**Map all affected roles** on a 2x2 grid based on their _Power_ (ability to approve/block) and _Interest_ (how much their job changes). a. **High Power/High Interest:** _Manage Closely_ (Executive Sponsor, **QGWG**). **Strategy:** Engage in weekly update meetings. b. **Low Power/High Interest:** _Keep Informed_ (Account Managers, Claims **Pros**). **Strategy:** Engage in training and solicit feedback monthly. c. **High Power/Low Interest:** _Keep Satisfied_ (Legal/Compliance). **Strategy:** Provide formal, quarterly security and governance reports.|_Deliverable:_ **Power/Interest Grid** determining communication frequency and content for each group.|
|**1.4. Establish AI Governance Framework**|The **QGWG** drafts the initial policy using **Qumis's** security guarantees as the foundation. a. **Mandate Private Document Vault:** Policy states all documents uploaded for analysis must use the **Qumis** Vault to ensure client data is protected. b. **Mandate Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Policy defines clear **CHECKPOINTS** where a human review is required. _Example: Any output used for a final claim decision or policy coverage explanation to a client._|_Deliverable:_ **"Qumis Responsible Use Policy" (v1.0)**, formally approved by Legal/Compliance.|

## Phase 2: Implementation, Process Redesign, and Communication

This phase adapts your core business processes to leverage **Qumis's** capabilities, ensuring that every team member understands their new, elevated role.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

You must be able to:

- **Lead Change Impact Assessment (CIA) Workshops:** Understand the process of gathering the "As-Is" data through interviews and mapping to generate the "To-Be" vision.
    
- **Translate Features to Benefit:** Understand how **Qumis's** features (e.g., **Compare Documents**, **Claims Assessment**) directly address the bottlenecks in your four core workflows.

### Step 3: Redesign Core Workflows with Qumis

The goal is to eliminate manual document analysis and errors, shifting hours to client interaction and strategic judgment.

| Workflow         | "As-Is" Bottleneck/Error                                                                                                                                                    | Qumis Feature Integration ("To-Be" Process)                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Success Metric (Time/Quality)                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **New Business** | Producer/Broker spends hours manually reviewing quotes and binders for non-obvious discrepancies before presenting to the client.                                           | **Broker/Producer** uploads competitive quotes to **Compare Documents**. **Qumis** instantly identifies true strategic leverage and non-standard exclusions. **Broker** uses this **Custom Report** to present authoritative advisory.        | **Time:** Reduction in **Quote-to-Bind Cycle Time**. **Quality:** 0 errors found in policy comparison audit.                                           |
| **Servicing**    | Account Manager (**AM**) searches for policy details across disparate systems to answer client coverage questions, often missing endorsements or amendments.                | **AM** uses **Chat with Documents** on the specific policy in the **Document Vault** to instantly verify coverage or find a specific exclusion clause. The **AM** can then use the **AI** to draft a compliant response.                      | **Time:** Reduction in **Average Handle Time (AHT)** for client coverage inquiries. **Quality:** Increase in **Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**.   |
| **Claims**       | Claims **Pro** spends days manually interpreting complex policy language (especially Errors and Omissions (E&O), **D&O**) and writing the rationale for denial or approval. | Claims **Pro** uses **Claims Assessment** for legal-grade reasoning for coverage decisions. The pro utilizes the **Fill In Checklist (BETA)** to systematically verify all policy elements before generating a defensible **Custom Report**.  | **Time:** Reduction in **Claims Cycle Time** for complex cases. **Quality:** Reduction in claims file "Audit-Identified Policy Interpretation Errors." |
| **Renewal**      | Broker/**AM** misses cross-sell opportunities or fails to highlight new risks because they lack time for deep policy analysis.                                              | **AM** uses **Policy Analysis** to master the expiring policy’s key limits and exclusions in seconds, instantly identifying coverage gaps based on the client’s risk profile. **Broker** uses the insight to prepare a targeted upsell pitch. | **Business:** Increase in **Retention Rate** and **Cross-Sell/Upsell Conversion Rate**.                                                                |

### Step 4: Role-Specific Communication and Buy-In 

Use a cascading communication plan, with managers delivering personalized messages to address specific fears and highlight professional growth.

| Role                     | Core Benefit from Qumis                                                  | Communication Strategy (Message to Deliver)                                                                                                                                                                  |     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| **Brokers**              | **Strategic Leverage** and **Faster Market Response**.                   | "Qumis makes you the **authoritative advisor** who moves faster than the competition. You get the **legal-grade insight** you need to **win more placements**."                                              |     |
| **Producers**            | **Faster Quote-to-Bind** cycle and **Policy Master** in seconds.         | "Your sales cycle shrinks. You can confidently discuss the complex coverage of a new placement and answer client questions instantly, increasing client trust."                                              |     |
| **Claims Professionals** | Accelerated, **Defensible Decisions**; **Elimination of Manual Errors**. | "Qumis acts like a **first-year associate, only faster and more accurate**, eliminating manual analysis errors and freeing you to focus on **judgment, negotiation, and client empathy**."                   |     |
| **Account Managers**     | **Time Recapture**; **Enhanced Customer Service**.                       | "Qumis is your new co-pilot for service. It frees up hours you spend digging for policy clauses, allowing you to handle more accounts and focus on **being the trusted advisor** and relationship builder."  |     |
| **Service Teams**        | **Expertise Democratization**; **Error Minimization**.                   | "You no longer need to wait for a senior underwriter to interpret complex language. Qumis gives you **attorney-level analysis** on demand, ensuring every client interaction is **accurate and compliant**." |     |

## Phase 3: Upskilling and Continuous Improvement (The Future State)

This phase locks in the cultural shift, emphasizing that **Qumis** is a learning partner that requires active engagement and iterative dialogue to deliver its best legal analysis.

### Required Pre-Project Knowledge

You must be able to:

- **Design Experiential Training:** Training must be hands-on, scenario-based, and focused on collaboration (**Iterative Dialogue**).
    
- **Sustain Momentum:** Implement an internal system to track best practices and continuously update the training materials.

### Step 5: Implement Attorney-Level Upskilling

The goal is to teach the team to treat the **AI** like a high-performing associate: clear instructions, critical review, and continuous discussion to refine the final work.

|Action|How to Execute (Step-by-Step)|Training Objective (The Collaborative Mindset)|
|---|---|---|
|**5.1. Foundational AI (Artificial Intelligence) Literacy & Ethics**|**Mandatory, documented training** for all staff. Cover: The difference between **Qumis** (specialized) and public Large Language Models (**LLMs**) (general). The **risk of bias** in any **AI** and the need for human ethical oversight.|_Objective:_ Ensure employees understand the **Privacy-First Approach** and the basic **HITL** mandate.|
|**5.2. Core Prompt Structure Training**|**Hands-on workshop** for all end-users. Teach the **"Persona-Context-Constraint-Format"** framework for prompting. a. **Persona:** "Act as a Commercial Lines Underwriter..." b. **Context:** "...reviewing this attached submission..." c. **Constraint:** "...cite only the policy clauses..." d. **Format:** "...and provide the output in a 3-bullet summary."|_Objective:_ Ensure accurate, structured data extraction for high-stakes tasks like claims and policy analysis.|
|**5.3. Advanced Iterative Dialogue Training (The Key)**|**Scenario-based lab** for Brokers/Claims **Pros**. Train the team to view the initial **Qumis** output as a _draft_ requiring an iterative dialogue to refine the legal reasoning. **Crucially, emphasize that Qumis's system enhances the prompts entered, but active discussion with the AI, by asking targeted follow-up questions or providing constraints, will result in a better, more comprehensive outcome.**. a. **Prompt 1 (Initial):** _Qumis provides a conclusion._ b. **Prompt 2 (Iterative):** "Thank you. Now, focusing only on the pollution exclusion on page 8, explain the counter-argument that the insured would use to fight this denial." (Forces the **AI** to consider the opposing legal view, deepening the analysis).|_Objective:_ Teach the team that **discussion** with the **AI** leads to a more comprehensive, **legal-grade reasoning** and a better final outcome.|
|**5.4. Legal-Grade Validation Lab**|**Mandatory, graded practical exercise.** Provide a complex document and an **AI**-assisted analysis. Require the user to **locate the citation or source text within the document** to validate **Qumis’s** conclusion. The pass/fail is based on the quality of the human's final **validation**, not the **AI’s** output.|_Objective:_ Embed the principle of **diligence** and continuous critical review before any submission or client communication.|

### Step 6: Monitor, Measure, and Evolve

1. **Monitor Adoption and Value (KPIs):**
    
    - **Adoption:** Track **Frequency of Use** (daily/weekly queries per user) and **Adoption Rate** (% of eligible staff using **Qumis** features in the new workflows).
        
    - **Time/Efficiency:** Measure **AHT** for client servicing and **Time-to-Quote** for new business submissions.
        
    - **Quality/Compliance:** Track the reduction in **Internal Audit Failures** related to policy or claim interpretation.
        
2. **Continuous Improvement Loop:**
    
    - **Quarterly QGWG Review:** Review **KPIs** and team feedback. Identify the top 3 best-performing prompts/workflows and add them to the central **Prompt Library**.
        
    - **Vendor Feedback:** Aggregate all reports of inaccurate/incomplete legal reasoning from the team and share with **Qumis** to leverage their **Bespoke** feature, where the "AI learns with use, becoming more personalized over time".
        
3. **Sustaining the Culture:** Recognize and reward the **AI Accelerators** (your champions) who are successfully using the iterative dialogue to drive superior business results and mentor their peers.
