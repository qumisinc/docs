# Change Management Toolkit

>Implementing Qumis isn’t about replacing professional judgment — it’s about **amplifying it**. Our platform is designed for the top minds in insurance, delivering attorney-trained AI to help your experts fuse their hard-won experience with legal-grade reasoning to deliver value faster and with greater precision.
>
>This playbook blends the **ADKAR change model** with **insurance-specific enablement tools**, practical training materials, and templates for leadership, compliance, and measurement. It’s written for organizations where expertise, tradition, and accountability matter — and where adoption succeeds only when people trust both the process and the product.

---

## The ADKAR Framework

**ADKAR** is the foundation for successful change:

1.  **Awareness** – Understand why change is needed
2.  **Desire** – Build motivation to support it
3.  **Knowledge** – Learn how to make it happen
4.  **Ability** – Apply new behaviors in real work
5.  **Reinforcement** – Sustain and expand adoption

Each phase is paired with practical templates, exercises, and tools in this guide.

---

## Step 0: Assess Readiness & Define Success

Before communicating the change, leadership must align on the goals and assess the organization's readiness. A clear starting point and destination are critical for success.

### Leadership Alignment Checklist

Use these questions to confirm strategic alignment before kickoff:

- [ ] Have we clearly identified the top 2-3 business problems Qumis will solve (e.g., proposal speed, error reduction, renewal efficiency)?
- [ ] Have we defined the 3-5 key metrics that will define a successful pilot?
- [ ] Is the executive sponsor prepared to dedicate at least 2 hours per month to champion this initiative?
- [ ] Have we used the **Value Tracker Pack** (see Step 4) to capture our *current* "before" metrics?

### The "Before" State Snapshot

Use the **Value Tracker Pack** to baseline your current metrics *before* the project begins. This transforms the tracker from a historical record into a proactive business case tool, clearly demonstrating ROI later.

---

## Step 1: Build Awareness

### Purpose

Help everyone understand **why** Qumis is being introduced and what challenges it solves.

### How to Build Awareness

-   Deliver a **leadership message** linking Qumis to real pain points.
-   Show before-and-after visuals: **Expert Review vs. Expert + Qumis Review**.
-   Address security questions head-on. Communicate that Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified**        and that **client data is always private and never used for AI training**.
-   Host “Why Qumis?” sessions to invite discussion and feedback.

### Communication Template

| Item | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | What to communicate | “Qumis cuts manual policy reviews by 60%, freeing our best minds for client strategy.” |
| **Audience** | Who needs to hear it | Producers, brokers, account managers, claims teams |
| **Messenger** | Who delivers the message | Executive sponsor and direct managers |
| **Key Objections** | Preemptive answers | "Is our data safe? Yes. Qumis is SOC 2 certified, and client data is private and never used for model training." |
| **Method** | Channels | Email, huddles, recorded demos |
| **Timing** | When | Week 1 of rollout |
| **Follow-up** | How to reinforce | Share FAQs (including security details), collect feedback, show early wins. |

> 💡 *Tip:* Use real customer or internal examples — people relate to stories, not statistics.

---

## Step 2: Create Desire

### Purpose

Turn understanding into **motivation**.

### How to Build Desire

1.  Show “what’s in it for me” for each role.
2.  Identify and empower champions early.
3.  Recognize early adopters and reward visible progress.
4.  Invite experts to co-author "Gold Prompts" (see Step 5) to build ownership and recognize their domain knowledge.

### The Competitive Edge

Motivation is driven by the desire to win and the fear of being left behind. Frame the conversation around the tangible business advantages Qumis provides.

**Use Testimonial Power:**
> "As Connor Love, National Director of Growth at IMA, noted: 'I thought, "No way it catches everything." But after using it on layered programs and seeing it find discrepancies I missed, I was sold.' Qumis acts as a second set of expert eyes, ensuring nothing gets missed."

**Frame Competitive Scenarios:**

| Scenario Question                                                                                                                                                   | Implications                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "A competitor using Qumis can analyze and compare 5 quotes in the time it takes us to do one. What does that mean for our next big renewal?"                        | Speed to market, winning more placements.     |
| "We can now provide an 'attorney-level' rationale for every claims decision, creating a defensible audit trail. How does this strengthen our client relationships?" | Increased trust, accuracy, and defensibility. |

---

### Updated Stakeholder Mapping Template

| Role | Influence Level | Likely Reaction | Why This is Likely | Engagement Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Senior Broker** | High | **Supportive** | Gains speed and leverage in client conversations. | Include in pilot and quote-comparison demos. |
| **Account Manager** | Medium–High | **Receptive** | Contract Review reports simplify renewals and COIs. | Prioritize demos; set “10 renewals in 30 days” quick-win goal. |
| **Claims Professional**| High | **Cautious** | Needs defensibility and clear audit trail. | Highlight human oversight and documentation steps. |
| **Service Team** | Medium | **Neutral → Supportive** | Repetition-driven; needs embedded SOPs. | Use short micro-trainings and office hours. |
| **Niche Specialist** | Medium–High | **Resistant / Skeptical** | Deep domain pride; fears AI dilution or overpromising. | Co-create “gold prompts” for their use cases; feature them as authors in shared library. |

---

### Motivation Plan Template

| Goal | Method | Owner | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Build momentum | Recognize “Qumis Champion of the Month” | Team Lead | Monthly meeting recognition |
| Reinforce benefits | Share real time-saved metrics | Change Manager | “Saved 4 hrs per renewal” |
| Encourage fun | Create internal leaderboard | Ops | Friendly cross-office challenge |

**Includes:**
1.  **Baseline form:** capture time per task, error rates, rework.
2.  **ROI calculator:** time saved × hourly rate = $ impact.
3.  **Dashboard template:** show adoption and efficiency metrics.

| Metric | Before | After | Δ | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Avg. review time** | 3 hrs | 30 mins | ↓83% | Policy comparison |

Embed this dashboard in monthly sponsor updates.

---

### Barrier Pulse & Playbook

Replace the static checklist with a **5-question pulse** survey (1–5 scale) tied to ADKAR.

| Element | Question | Low-Score Remedy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Awareness** | “I understand why we’re adopting Qumis.” | Re-share “Why Qumis” briefing & visuals |
| **Desire** | “I want to use Qumis in my work.” | Highlight time-saved stories or peer demos |
| **Knowledge** | “I know how to use Qumis.” | Assign micro-module or office hours |
| **Ability** | “I can perform my tasks using Qumis.” | Offer 1:1 coaching or co-working session |
| **Reinforcement** | “We keep using Qumis regularly.” | Add recognition, refresh prompts, share data |

---

## Step 5: Reinforce the Change

### Purpose

Make adoption durable — the new normal, not a project.

### Reinforcement Tactics

-   Track metrics monthly.
-   Recognize visible usage.
-   Share impact stories.
-   Update SOPs and the prompt library quarterly.

---

### Adoption Metrics Dashboard

| Metric                  | Target  | Actual | Status       |
| :---------------------- | :------ | :----- | :----------- |
| **Active Users**        | 80%     | 65%    | 🔸 Improving |
| **Documents Processed** | 200     | 190    | ✅ On Track   |
| **Time Saved (%)**      | 50%     | 48%    | ✅ On Track   |
| **User Satisfaction**   | 4.0 / 5 | 4.3    | ✅ Achieved   |

---

### The Living Library of Expertise (Prompt Catalog)

**Purpose:** Standardize high-performing prompts, reduce “prompt fatigue,” and create a central hub for shared knowledge that is curated and grown *by your team*.

**Recommended Patterns**
| Pattern | Use Case | Example Prompt | Expected Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coverage Comparison** | Quote vs. quote | “List coverage gaps between A and B policies.” | 3–5 bullet summary |
| **Exclusions Spotlight** | Identify exclusions | “Highlight exclusions affecting property or liability.” | Bullet summary |
| **Contract Obligations Extract**| For COI/Contract Review | “Summarize all insurance obligations in this contract.” | Clause list |
| **Claims Position Memo** | Claims advocacy | “Draft summary supporting coverage position.” | 1-page rationale |

**Anti-Patterns**
-   Asking multiple unrelated questions at once
-   Uploading unstructured or missing documents
-   Overloading context without clear focus

**Gold Prompts**
-   Co-authored with niche experts.
-   Reviewed monthly by department leads.
-   **Credited by name in the library to build ownership and recognize expertise**.

---

### Governance Starter Kit

| **Annual Awards** | Yearly | HR | “AI Innovator of the Year.” |

---

## Role-Based SOP Inserts (Appendix)

Provide a one-page printable SOP for each workflow.

| Workflow | Purpose | Key Steps | Escalation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prospecting** | Understand prospect coverage fast | Upload client policies → Run Chat → Export summary | Conflicting limits |
| **Quote Analysis** | Compare quotes/binders | Upload docs → Compare → Review summary | Missing attachments |
| **Policy Checking** | Verify coverage & terms | Upload policy → Analyze → Review exclusions | Unclear endorsements |
| **Account Management** | Manage renewals & COIs | Use Coverage Table → Check compliance | Nonstandard clauses |
| **Claim Advocacy** | Support coverage positions | Run Claims Analysis → Generate memo | Uncertain policy language|

Each insert should list prompt examples, visual cues (✅ vs. ⚠️), and “when to ask for review.”
