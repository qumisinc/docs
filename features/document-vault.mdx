# Document Vault

> The **Vault** is your secure digital filing cabinet for all insurance-related documents. Upload PDFs, Word files, Excel sheets, or images and make them instantly accessible for Chats, Comparisons, Claims, and Custom Reports.

---

## What is the Vault?

- A centralized repository for all your uploaded files.
- Files stored here can be used across all Qumis tools — Chats, Comparisons, Claims, and Custom Reports.
- **My Vault** is private to you and only you can see your files.
- **Shared Vault** is visible to everyone in your company, allowing teams to collaborate on shared insurance policies and supporting documents.

---

## Before you start

- Have documents ready to upload (PDF, Word, Excel, images: JPG/PNG/TIFF).
- Know whether documents are for your personal use (My Vault) or team collaboration (Shared Vault).

---

## 1) Open the Vault

1. From the left sidebar, click **Vault**.
2. You'll see two tabs:
    - **My Vault** — your private document space.
    - **Shared Vault** — shared company-wide document storage.

## 2) Upload a document

You have two ways to add documents to your Vault:

### Method 1 — Upload directly from your computer

#### Option A — Drag and drop

1. Simply drag your file(s) into the **Drop files here** box at the top of the Vault page.
2. Once the upload completes, a green confirmation will appear next to your file name.

#### Option B — Use the file picker

1. Click inside the **Drop files here** box.
2. This opens your computer's file browser (Finder or File Explorer).
3. Select one or more documents to upload, then click **Open**.

Supported file types: **PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, TIFF**.

> **Tip:** You can upload multiple files at once.

### Method 2 — Email documents directly to Qumis

You can send documents directly to your Vault without logging into Qumis by emailing them to **clerk@qumis.ai**.

1. Attach one or more documents to an email (supported formats: PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, TIFF).
2. Send the email to **clerk@qumis.ai**.
3. Your documents will automatically appear in your **My Vault** within a few minutes.

This is a convenient way to capture quotes, binders, endorsements, and other documents as you receive them from underwriters, brokers, and other contacts—no need to remember to upload them later from storage.

> **Tip:** Use descriptive email subject lines to help organize your documents (e.g., "ABC Corp Quote Jan 2025"). The subject line will help you identify the document in your Vault.

---

## 3) Confirm successful upload

Once uploaded, your document appears in **My Vault** with a green highlight and checkmark. Each file shows:

- **Name** — file title (editable with the pencil icon).
- **Type** — document category such as _Reference_ or _Attachment_.
- **Created At** — the upload date.
- **Actions** — options to delete or manage the file.

### Set document type (optional but recommended)

After uploading, click the **Select Document Type** dropdown to categorize your file. This makes it easier to search and organize files later.

---

## 4) Manage and organize files

As your Vault grows, use these tools to stay organized:

- **Search bar** — find documents by name. Type a document name to locate it instantly.
- **Type filter** — filter by _Reference_, _Attachment_, or _All Types_ to view specific categories.
- **Sorting** — click **Name** or **Created At** column headers to reorder your files.
- **Pagination** — navigate between pages of files using the arrows at the bottom if you have many documents.

> **Best practice:** Name files descriptively so they're easy to find later, e.g., "Acme Corp Property Policy 2025.pdf" instead of "policy.pdf".

---

## 5) Using Shared Vault for team collaboration

The **Shared Vault** lets your entire team work with the same documents.

- Documents in **Shared Vault** are visible to **everyone in your company** (but not outside your organization).
- Perfect for teams that collaborate on policy reviews, client files, binders, or endorsement documents.
- Everyone can access and analyze the same files in Chats, Comparisons, and other tools.

### Best practices for Shared Vault

- **Upload finalized documents** — use Shared Vault for completed policies and shared resources, not drafts.
- **Keep current versions** — when a policy renews or changes, upload the new version so everyone has the latest information.
- **Use clear naming conventions** — help your team find files quickly with descriptive names like "ClientName_Policy_Year" so everyone knows what they're looking at.
- **Communicate changes** — if you update or replace a shared document, let your team know so they use the correct version.

---

## 6) Edit or delete files

### Rename a document

1. Click the **pencil icon** next to the file name in the **Name** column.
2. Type a new name and confirm.

### Delete a document

1. Click the **trash icon** in the **Actions** column.
2. Confirm the deletion.

> **Note:** If you delete from **My Vault**, only you lose access. If you delete from **Shared Vault**, everyone in your organization loses access to it—use caution when deleting shared documents. Consider messaging your team before removing shared files.

---

## 7) Use Vault files across Qumis tools

Once documents are in Vault, you can access them from anywhere in Qumis without re-uploading:

- **Chats** — Click "Search and Add Documents From Vault" to pull documents directly into your chat and ask questions about them.
- **Comparisons** — Compare multiple documents stored in Vault side-by-side.
- **Claims** — Evaluate coverages from stored claims documents.
- **Custom Reports** — Generate professional summaries from Vault documents.

This saves time and ensures every tool works with the same trusted document source.

---

## Example workflow

1. **Upload** a new client policy to **My Vault** with a descriptive name (e.g., "ABC Manufacturing General Liability 2025").
2. **Analyze it in Chat** by creating a new chat, searching for the document in Vault, and pulling it in.
3. **Ask questions** about the policy to get analysis and insights.
4. **Share with your team** by uploading the document to **Shared Vault** so colleagues can access and analyze it too.
5. **Reuse documents** in future chats, comparisons, and reports without re-uploading—just search for them in Vault.

---
## Best practices

- **Start with key documents** — upload your most-used policies, quotes, and templates so you can build your collection over time.
- **Use descriptive names** — future you and your teammates will appreciate clear file names.
- **Organize by client or type** — consider naming conventions that group related documents together logically.
- **Leverage Shared Vault for team efficiency** — if you work in a team, use Shared Vault for policies your whole team needs so nobody has to hunt for files.
- **Clean up old versions** — periodically review your vault and delete outdated documents to keep things tidy.
- **Upload once, use everywhere** — pull documents into Chats and other tools from Vault instead of re-uploading the same file multiple times.

---

## Troubleshooting

**I don't see my file after uploading.**

- Wait a few seconds for the upload to finish. Try refreshing the page. Confirm the file is in a supported format (PDF, Word, Excel, JPG, PNG, or TIFF).

**I uploaded to the wrong vault (My Vault vs. Shared Vault).**

- You can re-upload the document to the correct vault. Delete the original from the wrong location if needed.

**Can others outside my company see Shared Vault files?**

- No. Shared Vault is organization-only and visible only to people in your company.

**I want to delete a document but I'm not sure if anyone else is using it.**

- If it's in Shared Vault, consider messaging your team before deleting to avoid disrupting their work. If it's in My Vault, only you have access, so you can delete freely.

**I accidentally deleted a file.**

- Files are permanently deleted, but you can re-upload a copy if you have the original on your computer.
