>The **Prompt Library** helps you create, save, and reuse structured AI instructions—called _prompts_—for faster and more consistent insurance document analysis. Whether you're drafting a detailed policy analysis or refining a question for Chat, the Prompt Library keeps your best prompts at your fingertips.

---

## What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is a reusable instruction you give to Qumis AI. For example:

> "Review this policy for exclusions related to subcontractor work and summarize findings for a contractor client."

Unlike general AI tools, Qumis is purpose-built for insurance professionals. The insurance expertise and reasoning are already built in—you don't need to tell Qumis to "think like an expert" or give it a persona. Simply focus on what you want analyzed and how you want the output formatted.

Prompts are great for:

- Standardizing analysis across your team.
- Quickly generating complex outputs (like coverage tables or policy comparisons).
- Saving your coverage checklists and frequently used review workflows.
- Reducing repetitive typing in Chats or Reports.

Once created, you can reuse a saved prompt anywhere in Qumis—in **Chats** or **Reports**—by clicking the book icon and selecting it.

---

## Before you start

- Have a sense of the types of questions or analyses you perform frequently.
- Know whether you want to create a prompt from scratch or refine an existing question using Qumis's prompt enhancement tool.

## 1) Access the Prompt Library

1. Click **Prompts** from the left sidebar.
2. You'll see a searchable list of saved prompts on the left and a detail view on the right.

## 2) Browse existing prompts

The Prompt Library includes built-in and saved prompts. Each prompt shows:

- A descriptive title (e.g., "Workers Comp Review," "Cyber Coverage Analysis")
- A brief description of what the prompt does
- Associated documents or context

Click any prompt to view its full content and use it.

---

## 3) Create a new prompt

1. Click the **\+ Create New** button in the upper-right corner.
2. A form appears with two fields:
   - **Prompt Name** — give your prompt a clear, descriptive title (e.g., "Extract All Coverage Limits" or "Commercial General Liability Checklist")
   - **Enter prompt content...** — type your instruction or question
3. Write your prompt in plain English. Qumis will understand and execute it when used later. Focus on:
   - What task you want Qumis to perform
   - What information to extract or analyze
   - How you want the output formatted
   - Any specific focus areas

Since Qumis is built specifically for insurance professionals, the expertise is already built in—just describe what you need analyzed and how you want it presented.

**Example: Analysis Prompt** "Review this policy for exclusions related to subcontractor work. Summarize findings in a client-friendly format highlighting risks."

**Example: Coverage Checklist Prompt** "Using this Workers Compensation policy, verify coverage for the following: Employee classifications, state coverage, occupational disease coverage, employer's liability limits, and voluntary compensation. Flag any missing or inadequate coverages."

## 4) Refine your prompt with the magic wand

On the right side of the prompt editor, you'll see a **magic wand icon**. Clicking it activates Qumis's AI-powered refinement tool, which automatically improves your prompt for clarity, focus, and impact.

The magic wand works best when your initial idea is broad—let Qumis rewrite it into a professional-grade prompt by:

- Adding specific instructions
- Clarifying the desired output format
- Suggesting relevant data fields to extract
- Improving structure and specificity

You'll also find this magic wand in **Chats** and **Report creation** to polish ad-hoc questions into stronger prompts.

> **Tip:** The wand works best with broad starting questions. The more general your initial prompt, the more value the enhancement will add.

2. Your new prompt now appears in the left panel list and can be reused at any time.
3. Your prompt is stored securely in your Qumis account and is accessible in other modules.

## Best practices for creating prompts

- **Save your coverage checklists.** Convert the coverage verification checklists you use repeatedly into Prompt Library items. This ensures consistent coverage audits across your team and clients.
- **Document frequently asked questions.** Save common questions or analyses you perform (e.g., "Check for independent contractor coverage," "Summarize all exclusions").
- **Start broad, then refine.** Write your idea plainly, then use the magic wand to make it stronger.
- **Be descriptive with names.** Use clear, specific names like "WC Coverage Verification Checklist" or "Cyber Exclusions Audit" for easy searching.
- **Write detailed instructions.** The more specific your prompt, the better Qumis's analysis. Include context about what you're evaluating and why.
- **Specify output format.** Tell Qumis how you want results—table, list, narrative summary, checklist, etc.
- **Include focus areas.** Mention what's most important (e.g., "Flag gaps in contractor coverage" or "Highlight non-standard terms").
- **Group prompts by function.** Organize by use case: "Coverage Checklists," "Claims Analysis," "Quote Comparison," "Client Reports," etc.
- **Test before sharing.** Use a prompt on a sample document first to make sure it works as intended.
- **Reuse across tools.** A single prompt can power Chats, Reports, and document analyses.
- **Iterate over time.** Improve prompts based on results. Use the magic wand to refine prompts that aren't working as expected.

## Example prompts to get you started

**Coverage Checklists:**

- "WC Coverage Verification Checklist: Verify this Workers Comp policy includes employee classifications, state coverage, occupational disease coverage, employer's liability limits, and voluntary compensation. Flag any gaps."
- "General Liability Audit: Review this GL policy and confirm: named insureds match our records, coverage territory is correct, coverage limits are adequate for the business, and no unusual exclusions apply."
- "Cyber Policy Coverage Check: Confirm this cyber policy covers: first-party data breach response, third-party liability, regulatory fines, business interruption, and ransomware. Note any exclusions or sublimits."

**For brokers:**

- "Compare this quote to the incumbent policy and identify 5 key differences that represent either better coverage or cost savings. Format for client presentation."
- "Extract all premium, taxes, and fees in a table format for proposal presentation. Include comparisons to current policy if available."

**For claims professionals:**

- "Analyze this claim scenario against the policy and determine if coverage applies. Cite specific policy language supporting your conclusion."
- "Identify all policy conditions, exclusions, and endorsements relevant to this type of claim. Flag any that may limit coverage."

**For risk professionals:**

- "Summarize all coverage limits, sublimits, and deductibles by line of business in an easy-to-read table format."
- "Extract all policy requirements and obligations the insured must follow to maintain coverage. Highlight those most critical for ongoing compliance."

## Troubleshooting

**I don't see my saved prompt in Chats or Reports.**

- Make sure it was saved successfully in the Prompts Library. Refresh the page and look for it under the book icon menu.

**The magic wand didn't change my prompt.**

- Try giving it a broader or more general starting point for better results.

**I can't save a prompt.**

- Check that both the name and text fields are filled in.

**I want to modify a prompt but don't want to lose the original.**

- Create a new version with a slightly different name (e.g., "Extract Limits" vs. "Extract Limits - Client Facing"). Both versions will be available.

**My prompt returns different results on different policies.**

- This is normal—Qumis adapts responses based on document content. Refine your prompt to be more specific if you need more consistent output. Use the magic wand to add structure and clarity.
