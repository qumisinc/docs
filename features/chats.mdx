>Use Qumis’ **Chats** to ask natural-language questions about your insurance documents and get attorney-grade answers with citations. This guide walks you through the whole flow—from opening Chats to asking questions, saving work, and troubleshooting.

---

## What you can do with Chats (at a glance)

- Ask plain-English questions about policies, quotes, binders, applications, contracts, and claims docs.
- Get structured answers with legal-grade reasoning and references.
- Keep documents private; data in Qumis is **not used to train** the AI and is stored in a private encrypted vault.

---

## Before you start

- Have one or more documents ready (PDF, Word, Excel, images: JPG/PNG/TIFF).
- If your files are already in **Vault**, you can pull them directly into a chat later.

---

## 1) Open the Chats workspace

1. From the left sidebar, click **Chats**.
   - On **Home**, you’ll also see other tools like _Chat with Documents_, _Compare Documents_, _Claims_, _Policy Analysis_, and _Contracts_ (all accessible from the same sidebar later).

## 2) Start a new chat

1. In **Chats**, click **New Chat** at the top of the list.
2. You’ll see a welcome message and two ways to add files:
   - **Search and Add Documents From Vault** (pull existing files), or
   - **Drop files here** (drag & drop from your computer).

/>

> **Tip:** You can add more than one file to the same chat to ask cross-document questions (e.g., compare a quote to a policy).

---

## 3) Add documents

### Option A — Upload from your computer

1. Drag a file into the **Drop files here** box, or click it to select a file.

### Option B — Pull from Vault

1. Click in the **Search and Add Documents From Vault** bar.
2. Search by file name and select the document(s) you want.

> **Security note:** Documents live in your private, encrypted **Vault**; they remain protected and reusable across workflows.

---

## 4) Wait for automatic OCR & ingestion

- After you add files, Qumis runs OCR and parsing automatically.
- You’ll see a **Processing OCR** progress window with a checkmark when each file finishes.

If you close the window accidentally, don’t worry—processing continues in the background and you can start typing your question once the file shows as loaded.

---

## 5) Get oriented to the chat screen

Once at least one document is loaded, the chat view shows:

- **Documents** menu (top-right of the chat pane) with a badge count (e.g., “1”).
- **Hide Citations** toggle (top-right). Turn this off to **see** reference citations in responses.
- **Suggested actions** (buttons) to help you get started, such as:
  - _Analyze policy coverage_
  - _Identify key exclusions_
  - _Compare coverage to industry standards_
  - _Check for specific endorsements_

/>

- **Chat list** (left sidebar) with your recent and older chats. Click any item to reopen it. You’ll also see pagination at the bottom of the list.

---

## 6) Ask your first question

1. Click a suggested action **or** type a question in your own words.
   - Example: _“Does this policy cover independent contractors?”_
2. Press **Ask ↵**.

Qumis reads the uploaded document(s) and replies with an answer. If citations are visible, click them to see the exact source passages extracted from your files.

> **What kinds of analyses can I ask for?** Coverage checks, exclusions, policy requirements, legal compliance, claims assessments, and more.

---

## 7) Refine, dig deeper, and compare

- **Follow-ups:** Ask clarifying questions (“Show me where that exclusion is”) or ask Qumis to _quote the wording_ that supports the answer.
- **Multiple docs:** Add additional files via the **Documents** menu and ask cross-document questions (e.g., _“Compare this quote to the binder and list material differences.”_).
- **Explain it simply:** Ask for plain-language summaries to share with clients or teammates.
- **Turn citations on:** If the **Hide Citations** toggle is on, click it to turn citations **off** (so references show).

---

## 8) Save and find your work later

- Every conversation is saved automatically in the **Chats** list on the left with a timestamp.
- Click any past chat to reopen it and continue where you left off.

---

## Best practices (for non-technical users)

- **Start broad, then narrow.** Begin with a big question (“Summarize key coverages and limits”), then follow with specifics (“List all sublimits and deductibles with page cites”).
- **Ask for the ‘why’.** If you’re unfamiliar with an answer, ask Qumis to _explain_ it or _show the exact policy wording._
- **Use Vault for organization.** Keep your latest policy, quote, binder, and endorsements in Vault so you can pull them into a chat quickly.
- **Respect privacy standards.** Qumis is SOC 2 Type I and does **not** train on your data. You can safely analyze client materials.

---

## Troubleshooting

**I don’t see my document after uploading.**

- Wait for the **Processing OCR** window to finish. If it stalls, remove the file and re-add it. Check that the file type is supported (PDF, Word, Excel, JPG/PNG/TIFF).

**Responses don’t show citations.**

- Toggle **Hide Citations** off (top-right).

**My question seems too broad.**

- Use a suggested action (buttons under the chat box) to guide the analysis, then ask follow-ups.

**I need to find an older conversation.**

- Scroll the chat list on the left, or use pagination at the bottom to move between pages.

---

## Example prompts you can copy

- “Summarize all coverages and limits in this policy. Include a short explanation for each.”
- “List every exclusion and where it appears. Flag anything unusual.”
- “Compare the quote to the policy and tell me material differences and potential gaps.”
- “Does this cover independent contractors? Cite the clause.”
- “Extract all policy requirements and obligations I need to track.”
- “Explain the deductible and sublimit structure like I’m new to insurance.”

## Where Chats fits in the Qumis platform

Chats sits alongside **Compare Documents**, **Claims**, **Policy Analysis**, and **Contracts** to cover end-to-end insurance analysis. Many users start in Chats, then move to comparisons or report generation for client-facing deliverables.
