## Company values

*These values are the foundation for what we do and how we do it.*

1. **Grit.** We succeed through grit. Passion and perseverance for long-term goals is what separates us.
2. **No Speed Limits.** We are on the autobahn together — unlimited speed, but under control. Speed determines whether our company succeeds or not.
3. **Relentless Resourcefulness.** We want people who could get us out of a third world prison.
4. **Beginner's Mind.** We approach everything with no preconceptions.
5. **Optimism.** We have faith in ourselves and trust the process.
6. **Sweat the Details.** We think things through as methodically as possible and deliver as much polish as possible given any constraints.
7. **Constant Learning.** If we aren't learning we aren't growing and that is counter to innovation.
8. **No Assholes.** Life is too short to have to deal with assholes.
9. **Fun to Be Around.** You spend a lot of time at work and should be around fun people.
10. **Growth Mindset.** We are here to grow and become better. To coast is to sink.
11. **Care About Doing a Good Job.** If you don't care about doing good work then why are you here?

### Interpersonal values

- All feelings are valid.
- The organization and its leaders have your back.
- Everyone is included and belongs.
- Our relational bonds are strong enough to survive any disagreements.

## Non-negotiables

*These are the behavioral expectations that define how we operate at Qumis. They are non-negotiable.*

- **Act with Extreme Ownership.** You own outcomes, not tasks. If something is incomplete, blocked, or broken, it's yours until it's fixed. "I didn't know" or "that wasn't my job" doesn't exist here.
- **Move at Founder Speed.** We operate with no speed limits. The default pace is fast, deliberate, and biased toward action. If something can be done today, it should not wait until tomorrow.
- **Make Indispensable Impact.** If you left tomorrow, Qumis should feel the loss. Your contributions must move the company forward in visible, measurable ways. If the company's velocity would be unchanged without you, you're not doing your job.
- **Have Depth and Conviction.** Work must show evidence of deep thought, edge-case coverage, and conviction. We expect judgment, initiative, taste, and forward-looking thinking.
- **Don't Be an Asshole.** We are collaborative, respectful, and candid. No toxicity, no arrogance, no politics. Strong opinions welcome, but delivered with humility and respect.

## CLEAR communication framework

A universal structure for sharp, persuasive business communication. Built on legal best practices, adapted for modern business teams. Use as a framework for all internal Qumis communications, both written and oral.

| Step | Element | Description |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| **C** | **Conclusion** | Start with your recommendation or key takeaway. Don't bury the lead. |
| **L** | **Landscape** | Describe the situation, problem, or opportunity. What's the context? |
| **E** | **Evaluation Criteria** | State the success metrics, decision drivers, or constraints. |
| **A** | **Analysis** | Apply the criteria to the facts. Present your reasoning with data. |
| **R** | **Recommendation** | Reaffirm your conclusion and suggest clear next steps. |

### Example

**C:** *"We should move forward with guided onboarding for all enterprise clients."*

**L:** *"Self-serve onboarding is taking too long, and we're seeing drop-off before first value."*

**E:** *"We aim for first value in under 14 days, with minimal CSM time and high CSAT."*

**A:** *"In our pilot, guided onboarding cut time-to-value in half and raised CSAT by 30%."*

**R:** *"Let's scale guided onboarding next quarter and allocate a dedicated onboarding lead."*

## Customer communications style guide

### Tone & voice

- **Professional, but approachable:** Write like an expert talking to another expert. Clear, respectful, never stiff.
- **Confident, never cocky:** Our tech is powerful — but we stay humble and factual.
- **Empathetic & human:** Acknowledge pain points and celebrate wins. Use active listening and affirm users' experiences.
- **Consultative, not salesy:** We guide, we don't push. Frame help and suggestions as collaborative problem-solving.
- **No fluff:** Every word should add value. Avoid corporate jargon and filler.

### Messaging principles

- **Clarity above all:** Be direct. Avoid passive voice or ambiguity. Structure information cleanly and logically.
- **Calm under pressure:** When something goes wrong, stay steady. Acknowledge, take ownership, and provide clear next steps.
- **Set expectations proactively:** Let customers know what to expect, how long something will take, and what you need from them.
- **Champion the customer's time:** Short, helpful, and efficient responses over long explanations. Link out to deeper info when needed.
- **Highlight impact:** Whenever possible, remind customers how Qumis is saving them time, risk, or confusion.

### Language & formatting

- Use complete sentences, not Slack-speak.
- When appropriate, include brief summaries or bullets for clarity.
- Use first names and always sign off with your name.

### The gut check

*"Would this message build trust with a seasoned insurance pro who's used to paper, PDFs, and old systems?" If not, rewrite it. And no typos EVER!*
