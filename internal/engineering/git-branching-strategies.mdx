<Accordion title="Quick Reference - Update Your Branch">

### Choose your update strategy:

#### Option A: Rebase (Recommended - Clean History)
```bash
git checkout release
git pull origin release
git checkout your-feature-branch
git rebase release
git push --force-with-lease
```

#### Option B: Merge (Safer - No Force Push)
```bash
git checkout release
git pull origin release
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge release
git push
```

<Warning>
If you see conflicts, you'll need to resolve them. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## The Core Problem

Since we are growing our engineering team and we will all merging PRs to the same branch asynchronously, we will regularly be out of sync.

**If another engineer merged their PR to `release` while you were working, your feature branch will be behind `origin/release`**

When your feature branch falls behind the remote release branch, creating a PR without updating causes:
- Other people's commits appearing in your PR
- Confused code reviewers
- Hidden feature scope
- Difficult merge conflicts
- Misleading git blame history

If you are out of sync, you will not reliably be able to ensure merging your feature branch will not introduce issues.


### What This Looks Like

**Out of Sync:**

```mermaid
---
config:
  logLevel: 'debug'
  theme: 'default'
  themeVariables:
      'git1': '#F0BF00'
---
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B"
    branch your-feature
    checkout your-feature
    commit id: "X (your work)"
    commit id: "Y (your work)"
    checkout main
    commit id: "C (colleague's work)"
    commit id: "D (colleague's work)"
    checkout your-feature
    commit id: "Z (your work)"
```

### What It Should Look Like


**In Sync:**

```mermaid
---
config:
  logLevel: 'debug'
  theme: 'default'
  themeVariables:
      'git1': '#00ff00'
---
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "B"
    commit id: "C (colleague's)"
    commit id: "D (colleague's)"
    branch your-feature
    checkout your-feature
    commit id: "X' (your work)"
    commit id: "Y' (your work)"
    commit id: "Z' (your work)"
```

## Step-by-Step: Rebase (Recommended)


<Tip>
Claude Code makes rebase or merge conflicts much easier! [See the Claude Code](#claude-code-can-help-with-conflicts) section.
</Tip>


‚úÖ **Use this for**: Regular feature branches, bug fixes, most daily work

<Steps>

### Update your local release branch

```bash
git checkout release
git pull origin release
```

### Switch to your feature branch

```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch  # e.g., erik/eng-984-add-auth
```

### Rebase onto the updated release

```bash
git rebase release
```

### Force push safely

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```
<Warning>
Never use `--force` alone. Always use `--force-with-lease` for safety.
</Warning>

</Steps>

### If You Hit Conflicts

```bash
# 1. Fix the conflicted files (your editor will show <<<< markers)
# 2. Stage the fixed files
git add .
# 3. Continue rebasing
git rebase --continue
# 4. Repeat if more conflicts appear
```

<Tip>
**Escape hatch**: If things go wrong, run `git rebase --abort` to undo everything.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step: Merge (Alternative)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use this for**: Long-running features, when rebase is too complex, or if you're not comfortable with force pushing

<Steps>

### Update your local release branch

```bash
git checkout release
git pull origin release
```

### Switch to your feature branch

```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch
```

### Merge release into your branch

```bash
git merge release
```

### Push normally

```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

</Steps>

## Our Branching Model

```
main (production)
‚îî‚îÄ release (staging)
   ‚îú‚îÄ erik/eng-983-feature-one
   ‚îú‚îÄ sarah/eng-984-feature-two
   ‚îî‚îÄ alex/eng-985-feature-three
```

- **Branch naming**: `engineer-name/ticket-id-description`
- **Base branch**: Always branch from `release`
- **Target branch**: Always merge back to `release`

## The Two Solutions

### Quick Comparison

| | Rebase (Recommended) | Merge (Alternative) |
|---|---|---|
| **Result** | Clean, linear history | Preserves exact timeline |
| **Safety** | Requires `--force-with-lease` | Normal push |
| **Best For** | Most feature work | Long-running branches |
| **Complexity** | Moderate | Simple |

<Info>
**Our Recommendation**: Use **rebase** for feature branches. It keeps our Git history clean and makes code reviews easier. Only use merge if you're uncomfortable with rebase or working on a long-running feature.
</Info>

### Claude Code Can Help With Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts during a rebase, Claude Code can help you resolve them:

```bash
# When you hit conflicts during rebase, ask Claude:
claude "I'm currently in the middle of a rebase that has merge conflicts. Can you help me resolve them and finish the rebase?"
```

Claude Code will analyze the conflicts, help you resolve them, and complete the rebase process.

### Making Rebasing Easier - Recommended Git Config

These git configurations will make rebasing smoother and more automated:

```bash
# Remember how you resolved conflicts and reuse those resolutions
git config --global rerere.enabled true
git config --global rerere.autoUpdate true

# Automatically stash and unstash changes during rebase
git config --global rebase.autoStash true
```

<Tip>
**What these settings do:**
- `rerere` (REuse REcorded REsolution) remembers how you resolved conflicts and applies them automatically next time
- `autosquash` automatically reorders commits marked with `fixup!` or `squash!`
- `autoStash` stashes any uncommitted changes before rebasing and applies them after
</Tip>

```bash
# For rebase conflicts:

git add .
git rebase --continue

# Too many conflicts? Abort and try merge instead:
git rebase --abort
git merge release  # Try merge strategy instead

<Accordion title="Git says 'cannot push' after rebase">
You need to force push after rebasing:

<Accordion title="I want to start over completely">

# Save your work first!

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

- Update your branch **before** creating a PR
- Use `--force-with-lease` (never just `--force`)
- Pull from `release` at least once daily
- Ask for help if confused (#engineering channel)
- Test your code after updating

### üõë DON'T

- Create PRs without updating first
- Force push to `main` or `release`
- Rebase commits others are using
- Mix rebase and merge randomly
- Panic

## Command Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Update your branch (Rebase)
git checkout release && git pull
git checkout your-branch
git rebase release
git push --force-with-lease

# Update your branch (Merge)
git checkout release && git pull
git checkout your-branch
git merge release
git push

# Emergency exits
git rebase --abort      # Cancel a rebase
git merge --abort       # Cancel a merge
git reset --hard HEAD~1 # Undo last commit (destructive!)
```
