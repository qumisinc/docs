Welcome to the Qumis engineering team! This guide will help you get set up with all the tools and access you need.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- GitHub account with access to Qumis repositories
- AWS account setup (coordinate with team lead)
- Slack access to the engineering channels

## Day 1: Essential Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Development Tools">
    Install the core development tools:
    ```bash
    # Install Homebrew (macOS)
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    # Install essential tools
    brew install git gh tree
    brew install pygitup  # Highly recommended for git sync
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install qumis-cli">
    Clone and install our internal CLI tool:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-cli.git
    cd qumis-cli
    make deploy

    # Verify installation
    qumis --version
    ```

    See [Tools Setup](/internal/engineering/tools-setup) for detailed instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure AWS Access">
    Set up AWS CLI and profiles:
    ```bash
    # Install AWS CLI
    brew install awscli

    # Configure AWS SSO
    aws configure sso
    ```

    You'll need profiles for:
    - `qumis_dev` - Development environment
    - `qumis_qa` - QA environment
    - `qumis_uat` - UAT environment
    - `qumis_prod` - Production environment (requires approval)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone Core Repositories">
    Clone the main repositories:
    ```bash
    # API Repository
    git clone https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-api.git

    # Web Application
    git clone https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-web.git

    # Infrastructure
    git clone https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-infra.git

    # Documentation
    git clone https://github.com/qumisinc/qumis-docs.git
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Day 2: Environment Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure qumis-cli">
    Set up your GitHub and Linear tokens:
    ```bash
    # Generate GitHub token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
    # Scopes needed: repo, workflow
    qumis config github.token <your-github-token>

    # Get Linear API key from: https://linear.app/settings/api
    qumis config linear.token <your-linear-api-key>

    # Verify configuration
    qumis doctor
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Local Development">
    For API development:
    ```bash
    cd qumis-api
    # Follow README.md for local setup
    bundle install
    rails db:setup
    ```

    For web development:
    ```bash
    cd qumis-web
    # Follow README.md for local setup
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test AWS Access">
    Verify your AWS access:
    ```bash
    # Login to development environment
    qumis aws login dev

    # List Lambda functions
    qumis lambda list-functions --env dev

    # View CloudWatch logs (if you have access)
    aws logs tail /aws/lambda/qumis-api --profile qumis_dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Day 3-5: Learn the Workflow

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   qumis feature my-feature --ticket ENG-123
   ```

2. **Keep your branch updated**:

   ```

3. **Create a pull request**:
   ```bash
   qumis pr create --title "Add new feature"
   ```
