Users signing up now go through a **complete self-service flow** with Stripe billing, email verification, and automatic organization matching by email domain. The **proposal generation engine has been rebuilt** with document metadata support and a new Cyber Liability template. A new **Chrome extension integration** lets users interact with Qumis directly from their browser, and **chat messages are now automatically classified** into 17 intent categories for analytics.

## Features

### Production Signup & Billing Flow

Complete self-service signup with Stripe billing, email verification, domain-based organization matching, and manual approval for personal email addresses.

- **Self-service Stripe billing** — integrated trial period tracking with trial end date extraction from webhooks
- **Email verification flow** — new Postmark templates for verification and invitation emails
- **Domain-based org matching** — users from known domains are automatically routed to their existing organization
- **Personal email approval** — manual approval workflow for Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo signups
- **PostHog analytics** — user identification and subscription event tracking across the signup lifecycle
- **Slack notifications** — alerts for new signups, existing-org matches, and completed registrations

**Linear:** [ENG-1582](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1582)

### Proposal Generation V3

Completely reworked proposal generation engine with document metadata support and a new Cyber Liability template.

- **New generation logic** — rebuilt across API and LLM services for more accurate proposals
- **Document metadata extraction** — improved context passed to the LLM for better coverage analysis
- **Cyber Liability template** — new proposal template seeded via rake task

**Linear:** [ENG-1591](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1591), [ENG-1598](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1598)

### Chrome Extension Support

Backend and frontend support for the Qumis Chrome extension, enabling users to interact with Qumis directly from their browser.

- **New chat source type** — `ext_chrome` for extension-originated conversations
- **OCR status in API** — document responses now include OCR processing status
- **URL-based document parsing** — extension deep links resolve document IDs from URL parameters

### Chat Intent Classification

Automatically categorizes user chat messages into 17 intent categories for analytics and future routing improvements.

- **17-category taxonomy** — covering policy analysis, claims, compliance, comparisons, and more
- **Full-stack integration** — classification flows from LLM through API to frontend
- **Backfill rake task** — reclassify existing messages with the new taxonomy

### Corrupt Document Detection

Validates document integrity on upload, catching corrupt PDFs and other damaged files before they enter the processing pipeline.

- **Client-side validation** — magic byte checks for PDF, DOCX, XLSX, and image formats
- **PDF structural verification** — parse and render validation using pdf.js catches corrupt content streams
- **Clear error messages** — specific feedback for corrupt, invalid, or password-protected files
- **Prevents silent failure** — eliminates 12+ minutes of wasted OCR processing on damaged files

**Linear:** [ENG-1719](https://linear.app/qumis/issue/ENG-1719)

### Mevan Data Extraction List

Support for Mevan data extraction list format, expanding the range of structured data the platform can process.
