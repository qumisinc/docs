## Features

### Automatic Report Retry with Email Notifications

Failed reports are now automatically retried up to 3 times with configurable delays. Users receive branded email notifications when their report is ready or when it permanently fails after all retries.

- **Automatic retry with backoff** — failed reports are re-queued via Sidekiq scheduled jobs with exponential delays
- **Report-ready emails** — users are notified as soon as their report completes successfully
- **Report-failed emails** — if all retries are exhausted, users receive a clear failure notification
- **TemplateMailer system** — new email infrastructure using API-stored templates with HTML and plain-text variants
- **Error tracking** — original error messages are now stored on job_report_email_requests for debugging
- **Support CC** — support@qumis.ai is CC'd on all template emails by default
