Ascend is Qumis's evidence-backed implementation and change management program. It is a core differentiator in enterprise sales conversations — not a professional services add-on, but a built-in component of every enterprise engagement. This section covers why Ascend exists, how to position it, and why no competitor can replicate it.

## Why Ascend Exists: The Evidence Base

Every element of Ascend traces back to real deployment data, not borrowed consulting methodology. Three findings from our own platform data and enterprise deployment experience shaped the program:

### The Activation Threshold

Users who analyze 20 or more documents within their first 30 days retain at 81%. Users below that threshold retain at 36% — a 45-percentage-point gap. Ascend is designed to drive every user past that threshold within the critical first month.

### The Ghost User Problem

When we scaled enterprise accounts without structured change management, ghost rates — users who received licenses but never activated — increased sevenfold. At one account, nearly half of provisioned users never logged in. The technology was identical. What was missing was structured onboarding, internal champion development, and workflow-specific use case design. Ascend was built to prevent this.

### The Center of Excellence Pattern

Our highest-performing accounts (90–100% active rates, 3–5x higher per-user engagement) share a common structure: they have internal "architects" — experienced coverage professionals who define how the team uses Qumis and serve as the go-to resource for colleagues. Ascend systematically creates this pattern at every deployment rather than hoping it emerges organically.

## How to Position Ascend

Ascend is not "onboarding." It is a structured, phased deployment program — discovery, pilot, validated expansion, ongoing optimization — designed by insurance professionals who understand coverage workflows at a practitioner level.

<Tip>
**Core message:** Qumis has deployed coverage intelligence at five of the top 15 U.S. brokerages and learned exactly what drives adoption and what kills it. Ascend is those lessons encoded into a repeatable program backed by real data.
</Tip>

The framing is always "this is how we ensure you succeed" — never "this is an extra service we offer." Ascend should appear in the sales process during discovery, not at contracting. When a prospect asks "what does implementation look like?", Ascend is the answer.

### By Audience

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Brokerage Executives & Operations">
    Ascend is how you de-risk an AI deployment. Most AI implementations in insurance fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because the change management isn't there. Our structured deployments achieve 90%+ active utilization rates, compared to the 47% industry average for enterprise SaaS license utilization. We built Ascend because we've seen both sides — we know what works and what doesn't, and we don't succeed unless your team actually uses the platform.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="IT & Operations Decision-Makers">
    Ascend minimizes the IT lift and maximizes adoption speed. We handle change management, role-specific training, and ongoing support so your team doesn't have to build an internal AI enablement function from scratch. Typical timeline: productive users within days, measurable impact within 30 days, validated expansion within 90 days.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Department Heads & Team Leaders">
    Ascend means your team isn't left to figure it out on their own. We build custom prompt libraries and analytical frameworks specific to your lines of business, provide hands-on training using your actual policies, and develop internal champions on your team who become the go-to experts — so adoption sustains long after formal onboarding ends.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Skeptical Practitioners">
    This is exactly why we built Ascend. We've seen what happens when AI tools get dropped on insurance professionals without proper context — they try it once, get confused, and never come back. Ascend is different because it's designed by people who've done coverage work professionally. The training uses your actual policies, not generic demos. The prompt templates reflect how coverage professionals actually think. And we track activation in real time — if someone is stuck, we know within days and intervene before they disengage.

## Ascend as Competitive Differentiator

Ascend is a competitive moat that workflow automation vendors and generic AI tools cannot replicate because it requires three things they don't have:

**Insurance domain expertise.** The people designing and delivering Ascend understand coverage analysis at a professional level. They can build prompt libraries that reflect how a D&O specialist thinks differently from a construction practice leader. They can facilitate training using real coverage questions and diagnose whether low adoption is a product issue, a workflow fit issue, or a training gap. Generic AI vendors can train users on their interface. They cannot train users on coverage analysis.

**Proprietary deployment data.** The activation thresholds, engagement benchmarks, champion patterns, and expansion triggers come from real usage data across hundreds of enterprise insurance users. This is evidence-based activation science specific to AI adoption in insurance, not theoretical change management methodology.

**A proven expansion playbook.** The phased approach — pilot to validated expansion to full deployment — has been refined through engagements that grew from initial pilots to hundreds of production users. The expansion path from 50 seats to 250+ that we've executed at enterprise accounts happened because the Ascend framework systematically creates the conditions for growth: executive sponsorship, internal champions, quantified impact, and a clear business case for the next phase.

When a prospect asks "what makes your implementation different?", the answer is: our competitors can provision accounts. They can't do this.

## Key Phrases for Ascend Conversations

- "We've deployed at five of the top 15 U.S. brokerages. Ascend is everything we learned about what drives adoption — encoded into a program."
- "Our structured deployments achieve 90%+ utilization. The industry average for enterprise SaaS is 47%. The difference is change management."
- "We don't just give your team a login. We build the workflows, develop the champions, and stay engaged until adoption is self-sustaining."
- "Whatever we do, it's got to be a contained, systematic rollout that shows we know what we're doing and we've done it before." *(Internal framing — captures the Ascend philosophy.)*
