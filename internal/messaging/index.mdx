## Messaging Goals

- For Qumis to be recognized as **the premier provider of Coverage Intelligence**
- Maintain and expand recognition of the **value Qumis brings to insurance experts**
- Empower Qumis employees, partners, and vendors/agencies to **speak with a consistent voice** across all channels and audiences

## Positioning at a Glance

> **Qumis is the coverage intelligence platform for commercial P&C insurance professionals.** Built by a licensed coverage attorney and AI experts, Qumis combines **legal-grade policy analysis** with **proprietary market intelligence** drawn from thousands of commercial insurance programs — delivering not just what a policy says, but **what it means in the context of the broader market**.

### Category Frame

We own **coverage intelligence** — a category distinct from workflow automation and generic AI. The competitive frame is:

- **vs. Workflow Automation** (FurtherAI, Fulcrum): They speed up document processing. We deliver **deeper document understanding + market intelligence**. Position as complementary, not competitive
- **vs. Generic AI** (ChatGPT, etc.): No domain expertise, no citations, no proprietary data. The gap is **structural, not incremental** — and it widens over time
- **vs. Outside Counsel**: Same analytical rigor at **10% of the cost and 10x the speed**. Reserve outside counsel for litigation; use Qumis for everything else
- **vs. Status Quo**: Amplifies human judgment. **Scales your best people's expertise** across the entire organization

### Five Core Value Propositions

1. **Legal-Grade Accuracy from Attorney-Trained AI** — founded by a licensed coverage attorney; citation-linked outputs; "I don't know" safeguards
2. **Coverage Intelligence, Not Workflow Automation** — proprietary insurance taxonomies; structured data extraction; coverage reasoning at scale
3. **Trusted by Enterprise Leaders** — 5 of top 15 U.S. brokerages; 127% NRR; SOC 2 Type I certified
4. **Built for How Insurance Actually Works** — Document Vault, Prompt Library, QumisScore; handles layered programs and endorsement towers
5. **Market Intelligence Powered by Proprietary Data** — 10,000+ commercial policies; coverage benchmarking against market standards

### Key Proof Points

| Metric | Value |
| :---- | :---- |
| Enterprise adoption | **5 of top 15** U.S. brokerages |
| Net revenue retention | **127%** |
| Pilot-to-paid conversion | **92%** |
| YoY ARR growth | **720%** (Q3 2025) |
| Policy review speed | **80% faster** (NFP) |
| Claims capacity increase | **+33%** (150 to 200 claims/month) |
| Single-month claim recovery | **$1.8M** |

### The One-Liner

**"Understanding the policy is the hardest problem in insurance."** — This is the single most important strategic phrase in Qumis's vocabulary. When a buyer agrees with this statement, they've already self-selected into our value proposition.
