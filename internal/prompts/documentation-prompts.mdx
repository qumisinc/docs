  Prompts for creating, reviewing, and transforming documentation.
</Info>

## Convert to Markdown

Convert content to clean Markdown format with proper formatting and escaping.

```markdown
Convert this to Markdown. Try to capture the original format as accurately as possible.

Return this as Markdown in a code block (i.e., ```Markdown ...```). Escape any characters necessary. Make sure that any Markdown code block is escaped properly. Do not respond with anything but the code block.
```

## Summarization

Create concise, audience-specific summaries of reports and documents.

<Tip>
**Best For:** Executive summaries, technical reports, customer communications

**Pro Tip:** Adjust word count based on audience - executives prefer 100-150 words, technical teams can handle 200-300 words
</Tip>

```markdown
Create a ~200 word summarization of the most important data from this report for <AUDIENCE>. Make it concise, extremely clear, and exceptionally readable.
```

**Placeholder Guide:**
- `<AUDIENCE>`: Your target readers (e.g., "executives", "technical team", "customers", "stakeholders", "board members")

**Usage Example:**
```markdown
Create a ~200 word summarization of the most important data from this report for executives. Make it concise, extremely clear, and exceptionally readable.
```

## Create llms-full.txt

Generate comprehensive documentation files from codebases or documentation sites, optimized for LLM consumption.

<Info>
  **Purpose:** Create LLM-optimized documentation files for AI assistants

  **Output:** Single Markdown file (≤100KB) with complete project information

  **Use Cases:** API documentation sites, code repositories, knowledge bases
</Info>

### For Documentation Sites

```markdown
You will be creating a Markdown file named llms-full.txt that contains all essential information from an input file, converted to clean Markdown.

Your task is to process this input and create a single Markdown file that follows these rules:

1. Begin with "# <Project Name>" on its own line.
2. Immediately follow with a concise 1-paragraph intro (no block-quote needed).
3. Inline the full Markdown of every important page in logical order (e.g. Quick Start, Concepts, API Reference, Guides).
4. Preserve headings (#–####), code fences, lists, tables, and images (![alt](url)). Strip any extraneous HTML, scripts, or navigation.
5. Do not add external links — inline the content instead.
6. Target ≤ 100 KB of output; summarise verbose or repetitive sections if needed, but keep code samples intact.

Follow these steps to create the output:
1. Identify the project name and create the top-level heading.
2. Write a concise 1-paragraph introduction summarizing the project.
3. Determine the logical order of important pages (e.g., Quick Start, Concepts, API Reference, Guides).
4. For each important page:
    a. Convert the content to clean Markdown.
    b. Preserve headings, code fences, lists, tables, and images.
    c. Remove any extraneous HTML, scripts, or navigation elements.
    d. Inline any external links by including the relevant content directly.
5. If the total content exceeds 100 KB, summarize verbose or repetitive sections while keeping code samples intact.

Provide your output as Markdown. The content of these tags should be exactly what would be written to the /llms-full.txt file, with no additional commentary or explanation.
```

### For Code Repositories

```markdown
You will be creating a Markdown file named llms-full.txt that contains all essential information from a code repository, converted to clean Markdown format optimized for LLM consumption and understanding, with strategic content extraction rather than complete file dumps.

Your task is to process the repository input and create a single comprehensive Markdown file that follows these rules:

1. Begin with "# <Project Name>" on its own line.
2. Immediately follow with a concise 1-paragraph intro describing what the project does, its main purpose, and primary programming language(s) used.
3. Include a **System Architecture Overview** explaining the application pattern, key components, and data flow.
4. Add a **Module Dependencies Map** showing critical file relationships and import chains.
5. Include a comprehensive file structure overview with file type indicators and role descriptions.
6. Extract and present **key code segments** from important files in logical order following the priority hierarchy below.
7. For each file, use appropriate code fences with language specification and semantic markers.
8. Focus on **interfaces, signatures, core logic, and architectural patterns** rather than complete implementations.
9. Apply smart filtering and extraction strategies for optimal LLM comprehension.
10. Target ≤ 100 KB with dynamic adjustment, prioritizing understanding over completeness.

**Enhanced File Priority Hierarchy (highest to lowest):**
1. **Core Entry Points**: main.py, index.js, app.py, server.js, main.go, etc.
2. **Primary Business Logic**: Core models, controllers, services, domain logic
3. **Configuration Files**: package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js
4. **Key Integration Points**: Database models, API interfaces, external service connectors
5. **Infrastructure**: Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .github/workflows, deployment configs
6. **Type Definitions**: .d.ts files, interface definitions, schema files
7. **Critical Utilities**: Helper functions, shared libraries, middleware
8. **Representative Tests**: Key unit tests, integration tests that demonstrate usage patterns
9. **Documentation**: README.md, API documentation, architectural decisions

Provide your output as Markdown optimized for LLM understanding, focusing on architectural clarity and strategic code examples rather than exhaustive file dumps.
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Tips for Documentation Prompts:**
  - **Convert to Markdown**: Use for screenshots, PDFs, or poorly formatted text
  - **Summarization**: Specify your target audience for better results
  - **llms-full.txt**: Choose the right tab based on whether you're documenting a docs site or codebase
  - **File Size**: Keep llms-full.txt files under 100KB for optimal LLM performance
