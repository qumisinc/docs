## Alignment on Objective

Identify gaps in understanding between user intent and AI interpretation to improve task alignment.

```markdown
Review our interaction(s) so far. Think about the differences between:
- My understanding of what I've asked/prompted you for (should usually be a high level since it's in my mental model)
- Your understanding of my mental model transferred to you via chats and prompts.

This is an inherently lossy process. Identify potential gaps in our understanding of the objective. How can we reach parity?

First identify the potential differences in our understandings and anything that is ambiguous or unclear. Then come up with a list of questions for me which, if answered, will increase our likelihood of being aligned on what my true objective is. For each of the questions, add a score (0.0-1.0) of how much you think the answered question will improve our alignment on objective.
```

## Chat Dump

Create a comprehensive backup of conversation data for knowledge transfer or session restoration.

```markdown
Create a comprehensive JSON dump of all of the data so far in this conversation so that if given to you (or another LLM) in a new instance, you could "ingest" it and retain the knowledge from this entire conversation.
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Tips for Operations Prompts:**
  - **Alignment on Objective**: Use early in complex projects to ensure you and the AI are on the same page
  - **Chat Dump**: Helpful for long conversations that you want to continue in a new session or share with team members
  - **When to Use**: Operations prompts are most valuable for meta-level workflow improvements
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Common Use Cases:**
  - **Alignment**: Complex multi-step projects, unclear requirements, cross-functional work
  - **Chat Dump**: Knowledge transfer, session backup, documentation of AI-assisted work
</Note>
