## Overview

The `build:md` script in this repository compiles every MDX page into clean Markdown and produces three combined bundles, each optimized for LLM consumption. The bundles are served as downloadable static assets — no manual export or copy-pasting required.

| Bundle | Pages | Size | Contents |
|--------|------:|-----:|----------|
| [llms-full.txt](/assets/internal/llms/llms-full.txt) | 91 | 628 KB | All documentation (external + internal) |
| [llms-external.txt](/assets/internal/llms/llms-external.txt) | 53 | 280 KB | Public-facing pages only |
| [llms-internal.txt](/assets/internal/llms/llms-internal.txt) | 38 | 348 KB | Internal pages only |

## How to Use It

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick the right bundle">
    Choose the bundle that matches your task:

    - **Full** — complete product + engineering context
    - **External** — product docs, marketing, customer-facing work
    - **Internal** — engineering workflows, deployment, infrastructure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download or open the file">
    Click a link above to download, or find the files at `assets/internal/llms/` in the repo.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to your AI tool">
    **ChatGPT / Claude** — Upload the file directly or paste its contents as context.

    **Cursor / GitHub Copilot** — Place the file in your project root or reference it in workspace settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask your question">
    Reference the docs in your prompt. For example:

    ```
    Based on the Qumis documentation above, how does the Document Vault feature work?
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The bundles are regenerated every time `npm run build:md` runs (including on commit via the pre-commit hook), so they stay in sync with the docs site automatically.
</Tip>
