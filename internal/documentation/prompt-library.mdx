### LLM Context Files

<Info>
  Downloadable context files to enhance LLM understanding of Qumis systems and documentation.
</Info>

#### What are LLM Context Files?

LLM context files (`.llms.txt` format) are specially formatted documents that provide comprehensive background information about Qumis to AI assistants. These files help LLMs understand our domain, terminology, architecture, and best practices when assisting with documentation, code generation, or analysis tasks.

#### Available Context Files

## Using Prompts Effectively

<Tip>
  **Best Practices for Prompt Usage:**
  - **Keep prompts focused**: Each prompt should target a single, well-defined task
  - **Customize placeholders**: Replace variables like `<DESCRIPTION>` or `[target]` with your specific details
  - **Test and iterate**: Try prompts with sample data before using them on important work
  - **Use context files**: Attach relevant Qumis context files for better, more accurate results
  - **Document tool requirements**: Some prompts need specific files (like `schema.json`) - note these dependencies
  - **Share improvements**: If you enhance a prompt, update it in the library and notify the team
  - **Attribute sources**: When adding prompts from external resources, include proper attribution
</Tip>
