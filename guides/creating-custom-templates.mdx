## Template Variables

Templates support dynamic variables that automatically populate with relevant data:

|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{client_name}}` | Client's full name | John Smith |
| `{{policy_number}}` | Policy identification number | POL-2024-001234 |

| `{{coverage_amount}}` | Total coverage amount | $1,000,000 |
| `{{agent_name}}` | Assigned agent name | Sarah Johnson |

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

Add conditional sections that appear based on specific criteria:

```text
{{#if coverage_type == "comprehensive"}}
  This policy includes comprehensive coverage with...
{{/if}}
```

### Calculated Fields

Include calculations in your templates:

```text
Premium Total: {{monthly_premium * 12}}
```

### Nested Templates

Embed one template within another for modular document creation:

```text
{{include "standard_terms_template"}}
```

## Managing Templates
