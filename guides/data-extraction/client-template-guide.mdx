## Template Columns

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **key** | Yes | Unique identifier for this field (lowercase, underscores, no spaces) |
| **label** | Yes | Display name shown in reports |

| **mapping** | Yes | Value type: `1` (single), `M` (multiple), or `C` (complex) |

---

## Value Types (Mapping)

### Type `1` - Single Value

Use for fields that have **exactly one value**.

**When to use:**
- Policy numbers, dates, names
- Single amounts (premium, deductible)
- Yes/No or single-choice fields

**Example format:**
```json
{"field_key": "value"}
```

**Examples:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Policy Number | `{"policy_number": "POL-2024-001"}` |
| Effective Date | `{"effective_date": "2024-01-15"}` |
| Premium Amount | `{"premium": 125000}` |
| Insured Name | `{"insured_name": "Acme Construction Inc."}` |

---

### Type `M` - Multiple Values

Use for fields that return a **list of simple values**.

**When to use:**
- Lists of items (perils, exclusions, locations)
- Multiple selections
- Tags or categories

**Example format:**
```json
["value1", "value2", "value3"]
```

**Examples:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Covered Perils | `["Fire", "Flood", "Windstorm", "Theft"]` |
| Exclusions | `["War", "Nuclear", "Pollution"]` |
| Named Insureds | `["ABC Corp", "XYZ Holdings", "Smith LLC"]` |
| Locations | `["Toronto, ON", "Vancouver, BC"]` |

---

### Type `C` - Complex Object

Use for fields that return **structured data with multiple properties**.

**When to use:**
- Tables or grids of data
- Items with multiple attributes
- Nested information

**Example format:**
```json
[
  {"property1": "value1", "property2": "value2"},
  {"property1": "value3", "property2": "value4"}
]
```

**Examples:**

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Coverage Limits | `[{"coverage": "Property", "limit": 5000000}, {"coverage": "Liability", "limit": 2000000}]` |
| Sublimits | `[{"peril": "Flood", "amount": 500000}, {"peril": "Earthquake", "amount": 250000}]` |
| Named Insureds with Role | `[{"name": "ABC Corp", "role": "Primary"}, {"name": "XYZ Inc", "role": "Additional"}]` |

## Writing Good Instructions

The **instructions** field tells the AI how to find and extract the value. Good instructions lead to accurate extractions.

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific** - Describe exactly what to look for
2. **List alternative names** - Include different terms that might be used
3. **Specify format** - Tell the AI how to format the output
4. **Provide context** - Explain where to look in the document

### Instruction Template

<Note>
Extract [what to find]. [Where to look]. [Format instructions]. [Alternative terms].
</Note>

### Examples

| Field | Good Instruction |
|-------|------------------|
| **Policy Number** | "Extract the unique policy identifier. Look in the declarations page header or policy information section. This may be labeled as 'Policy Number', 'Policy No.', 'Certificate Number', or 'Policy ID'." |
| **Effective Date** | "Extract the policy start date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). Look for 'Effective Date', 'Policy Period From', 'Inception Date', or 'Coverage Begins'. If only month/year is shown, use the 1st of the month." |
| **Deductible** | "Extract the per-occurrence deductible amount as a number without currency symbols. Look in the deductible schedule or declarations. May be labeled as 'Deductible', 'Retention', or 'Self-Insured Retention (SIR)'." |
| **Covered Perils** | "Extract all perils explicitly covered by the policy as an array. Look in the 'Covered Causes of Loss' or 'Insured Perils' section. Include both named perils and any 'all-risk' designation." |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
Review these common pitfalls to ensure your template is configured correctly.
</Warning>

| Mistake | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Using spaces in key | `policy number` | Use underscores: `policy_number` |
| Vague instructions | "Get the limit" | Be specific: "Extract the per-occurrence limit of liability from the declarations page" |
| Wrong mapping type | Using `1` for a list | Use `M` for lists, `C` for structured data |
| Missing example | No example provided | Always provide a realistic example |
| Inconsistent JSON | `{'key': 'value'}` | Use double quotes: `{"key": "value"}` |
