description: "Quick start guide for For IT and Identity Management Teams"
---

## Overview

This guide will help your IT team configure Single Sign-On (SSO) with Qumis. SSO allows your employees to access Qumis using your organization's existing identity provider credentials, streamlining access management and enhancing security.

Qumis supports both **SAML 2.0** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** protocols, making it compatible with all major enterprise identity providers including:

- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- Okta
- Google Workspace
- OneLogin
- Auth0
- Ping Identity
- And other SAML 2.0 or OIDC-compliant providers

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the SSO setup process, ensure you have:

- **Administrative access** to your organization's identity provider (IdP)
- **Contact with your Qumis representative** to coordinate the setup
- **Organization details** ready (domain(s) to be used for SSO)
- **User provisioning plan** (which users or groups should have access to Qumis)

## Setup Timeline

Typical SSO implementation takes 1-3 business days, depending on your organization's internal processes and IdP configuration complexity.

---

## Information Required from Your Organization

Your Qumis Customer Success team will request the following information to configure SSO on our end:

### 1. Organization Details

- **Email Domain(s)**: Domain(s) that will be used for SSO authentication (e.g., [yourcompany.com](http://yourcompany.com))
- **Primary Contact**: Name and email of the technical contact for SSO setup

### 2. Identity Provider Information

#### For SAML 2.0 Connections

- **IdP Entity ID / Issuer URL**: Unique identifier for your identity provider
- **SSO URL / Sign-On URL**: The endpoint where authentication requests will be sent
- **X.509 Certificate**: Public certificate from your IdP for validating SAML assertions
- **Attribute Mapping** (if different from defaults):
  - Email address attribute
  - First name attribute
  - Last name attribute

#### For OIDC Connections

- **Client ID**: OAuth client identifier from your IdP
- **Client Secret**: OAuth client secret (will be stored securely)
- **Authorization Endpoint**: URL for the OAuth authorization request
- **Token Endpoint**: URL for exchanging authorization codes for tokens
- **JWKS URI**: JSON Web Key Set endpoint for validating tokens
- **Issuer**: The identifier of your OIDC provider

---

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Contact Qumis Customer Success

Reach out to your Qumis Customer Success Manager or email [support@qumis.ai](mailto:support@qumis.ai) to initiate the SSO setup process. We'll schedule a brief kickoff call to review requirements and timeline.

### Step 2: Configure Qumis Application in Your IdP

Your IT team will need to add Qumis as an application in your identity provider. Qumis will provide you with:

- **Service Provider (SP) Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Qumis
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Where SAML assertions or OIDC tokens should be sent
- **Callback/Redirect URI**: For OIDC flows

_Follow your IdP's documentation to create a new SSO application with these values._

### Step 3: Provide Configuration Details to Qumis

Once you've configured Qumis in your IdP, send the required information (listed in the "Information Required" section above) to your Qumis representative securely.

**For SAML:** You can provide either:

- IdP metadata XML file, OR
- Individual configuration values (Entity ID, SSO URL, Certificate)

**For OIDC:** Provide:

- Client ID and Client Secret
- Well-known configuration URL (if available), OR
- Individual endpoint URLs

### Step 4: Qumis Configuration

The Qumis team will configure the SSO connection on our platform using the information you provided. This typically takes 1-2 business days.

### Step 5: Testing

Once Qumis confirms the configuration is complete:

1. **Initial Test**: A designated test user should attempt to log in to Qumis using SSO
2. **Verify User Details**: Confirm that user information (name, email) is populated correctly
3. **Test Different Scenarios**:
   - Existing user login
   - Access to appropriate resources and permissions

### Step 6: Production Rollout

After successful testing:

1. Enable SSO for additional user groups as planned
2. Communicate the new login process to your users
3. Update any internal documentation

---

## User Login Experience

Once SSO is configured, your users will access Qumis as follows:

1. Navigate to your organization's Qumis login page: `https://app.qumis.ai`
2. Enter their company email address
3. Click "Continue with SSO"
4. Users are redirected to your organization's identity provider
5. After authenticating with your IdP, users are automatically signed into Qumis

---

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- All SSO communications are encrypted using industry-standard TLS protocols
- Your IdP credentials are never stored by Qumis
- Qumis is **SOC 2 Type I certified** with enterprise-grade security
- Your organization's data remains private and is never used for AI training

### Authentication Flow

- SSO connections are scoped to your specific organization
- Each authentication request is validated against your IdP in real-time
- Session management follows security best practices with configurable timeout periods

---

## Multi-Organization Access (Advanced)

If your company has multiple Qumis organization instances (common with M&A activity, international subsidiaries, or separate departments), you can configure External SSO Connections to allow users to authenticate across organizations with a single SSO setup.

Contact your Qumis Customer Success Manager if this applies to your use case.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Users receive "SSO Configuration Not Found" error**

- Verify that the user's email domain matches the domain configured for SSO
- Confirm the SSO connection is active in Qumis
- Check that users are assigned to the Qumis application in your IdP

**SAML assertion errors**

- Verify the X.509 certificate is current and hasn't expired
- Confirm the ACS URL is correctly configured in your IdP
- Check that attribute mappings match expected values

**OIDC authentication failures**

- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Confirm redirect URI exactly matches the value in your IdP
- Check that required scopes (openid, email, profile) are granted

**Users created but missing information**

- Review attribute/claim mappings in your IdP configuration
- Verify that user profiles in your IdP contain the required fields

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can we enforce SSO as the only login method?**

A: Yes. Once SSO is configured and tested, Qumis will automatically disable alternative authentication methods for your organization.

**Q: What happens if our IdP experiences downtime?**

A: Users will be unable to log in via SSO during IdP downtime. Contact Qumis support if you need temporary alternative access enabled.

**Q: Can we configure multiple IdP connections?**

A: Organizations typically use a single IdP connection. Contact your Customer Success Manager if you have a specific use case requiring multiple connections.

**Q: How do we offboard users?**

A: Remove user access in your IdP by unassigning them from the Qumis application. They will be unable to authenticate on their next login attempt.

**Q: Does SSO support Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?**

A: Yes. MFA enforcement is managed through your identity provider. When MFA is required by your IdP, users will complete MFA as part of the SSO flow.

**Q: Can we customize the login page?**

A: Qumis provides a standard enterprise login experience. For custom branding requirements, please contact your Customer Success Manager.
