# Getting Started with Qumis Coverage Table: Your Guide to Streamlined Policy Comparison

Welcome to the Qumis Coverage Table feature - your powerful tool for comparing insurance policies with attorney-level precision. This guide will walk you through creating your first coverage comparison table, helping you unlock strategic insights that go beyond basic policy differences.

## Overview: What is the Coverage Table?

The Coverage Table is an AI-powered comparison tool that allows you to analyze multiple insurance policies side-by-side. Whether you're evaluating quotes, comparing renewal options, or assessing coverage gaps, this feature transforms complex policy analysis into clear, actionable insights.

## Step 1: Navigate to Coverage Table

From your Qumis dashboard, locate the **Coverage Table (BETA)** option in the left navigation menu. Click to enter the Coverage Table workspace where you'll see the "Create Coverage Table" option to begin your comparison.

## Step 2: Upload Your Policy Documents

Click **"Create Coverage Table"** to start. You'll be directed to the Policy Documents screen where you can:

- **Upload a single policy document** for initial analysis
- **Search and add documents from your Vault** using the search bar
- **Drag and drop files** directly into the upload area (supports PDF, Excel, Word, and image files including JPEG, PNG, TIFF)

For this comparison, you'll want to upload at least two policy documents - typically the incumbent policy and a competing quote, or multiple quotes you're evaluating.

1. **Copy and paste** coverage items from your existing proposal template or coverage checklist
2. **Select from our comprehensive checklist** of common insurance coverage elements

- Compile strategic insights
- Validate accuracy using attorney-trained reasoning

## Step 5: Review Your Coverage Comparison

Your completed Coverage Table provides a comprehensive side-by-side comparison showing:
- **Field-by-field coverage analysis** with clear status indicators
- **Match/Mismatch identification** highlighting differences between policies
- **Coverage gaps and advantages** clearly marked
- **Interactive review options** to dive deeper into specific coverage elements

Use the filter options to focus on specific coverage types, view only differences, or export the comparison for client presentations.

<Note>
The color-coded system makes it easy to identify:
- **Green (Match)**: Coverage elements that align across policies
- **Yellow (Partial)**: Areas with some differences that need review
- **Red (Mismatch)**: Significant differences requiring attention
- **N/A**: Coverage not found or not applicable
</Note>
