  </Step>
  <Step title="Backup Codes">
    Save your backup codes in a secure location
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your Setup">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Protection

### Document Handling Best Practices

<Tip>
Always verify document sensitivity levels before uploading to Qumis.
</Tip>

#### Before Uploading Documents

- **Review Content**: Check for sensitive information that should be redacted
- **Classify Data**: Understand your document's confidentiality level
- **Remove Metadata**: Clean documents of unnecessary metadata
- **Scan for Malware**: Ensure documents are virus-free

#### Document Storage

- **Organized Structure**: Use clear folder hierarchies and naming conventions
- **Access Controls**: Set appropriate permissions for shared documents
- **Regular Audits**: Review and remove outdated documents periodically
- **Version Control**: Maintain clear version history for important documents

### Data Privacy Measures

| Practice | Description | Frequency |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Access Review | Audit who has access to your documents | Monthly |
| Permission Updates | Remove access for users who no longer need it | As needed |
| Activity Monitoring | Review access logs and user activity | Weekly |
| Data Cleanup | Remove unnecessary or outdated documents | Quarterly |

## Network Security

### Secure Connection Practices

<Warning>
Never access Qumis over unsecured public Wi-Fi without a VPN.
</Warning>

#### Recommended Network Security

1. **Use HTTPS Only**: Always verify the URL starts with `https://app.qumis.ai`
2. **VPN Usage**: Connect through a VPN when using public networks
3. **Network Monitoring**: Be aware of unusual network activity
4. **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure your firewall allows secure Qumis connections

### Browser Security

#### Essential Browser Settings

- **Enable automatic updates** to receive security patches
- **Block third-party cookies** for enhanced privacy
- **Use private/incognito mode** when accessing from shared computers
- **Clear cache regularly** to remove stored sensitive data

## User Access Management

### Role-Based Access Control

Implement these principles for team accounts:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Principle of Least Privilege">
    Grant users only the minimum access required for their role
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Access Reviews">
    Audit user permissions quarterly and adjust as needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Immediate Deprovisioning">
    Remove access immediately when employees leave or change roles
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Segregation of Duties">
    Separate critical functions among different users to prevent conflicts
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Session Management

Best practices for secure sessions:

- **Auto-Logout**: Enable automatic session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Single Session**: Avoid multiple concurrent sessions when possible
- **Logout Completely**: Always use the logout button instead of just closing the browser
- **Clear Session Data**: Clear cookies and cache after using shared computers

## Incident Response

### What to Do If You Suspect a Security Breach

<Steps>
  <Step title="Immediate Action">
    Change your password immediately and log out all sessions
